# smoke.sh — non-destructive regression suite for the rlm Docker tooling.
#
# Exercises the real `rlm` command paths against the built image. Safe to run
# anytime:
#   • a FRESH throwaway volume is used for every guard check, so deploy/build
#     can never auto-confirm against a real org;
#   • the live state volume (default: rlm-state) is mounted READ-ONLY, and only
#     to make a throwaway copy — every org-aware command runs against the copy,
#     so the suite can never mutate the user's real credentials. Skipped if the
#     live volume isn't present.
#
# Usage:   docker/test/smoke.sh            (image must exist — `./docker/rlm setup`)
# Env:     RLM_IMAGE (default rlm-base:latest), RLM_STATE_VOLUME (default rlm-state)
# Exit:    0 if all checks pass, 1 otherwise.
