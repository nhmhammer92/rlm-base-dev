"""
Custom CumulusCI task for comprehensive Decision Table management.

This task provides functionality to:
- Query/list decision tables
- Refresh decision tables (full or incremental)
- Support other operations (activate, deactivate, etc.)

Modelled on the behaviour the ``RLM_Refresh_Decision_Tables`` screen flow used to
provide, which this task predates the removal of:
- Queries DecisionTable records with Status = 'Active'
- Uses refreshDecisionTable action
- Supports All / ByUsageType / Individual modes with incremental refresh toggle

⚠ That screen flow is GONE — do not go looking for it as a reference. In the org the
equivalents are the **Decision Table Manager** component on the Home page
(interactive, with a freshness verdict per table) and ``RLM_Refresh_Decision_Tables_Bulk``
(autolaunched; the only route Apex has to the refresh action). Do not confuse either
with ``RLM_Refresh_Decision_Tables_By_Usage_Type``, which is a different, live flow
called by ``RLM_Account_Utilities``. For headless verdicts see the
``check_decision_table_freshness`` task.
