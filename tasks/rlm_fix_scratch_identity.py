"""
CumulusCI task to repair scratch-org identity in the local Salesforce CLI auth file.

Works around an SF CLI v2.x bug where Enterprise-Edition ("ent"/workspace)
scratch orgs created via the DevHub API are written to the local auth file
(``~/.sfdx/<username>.json``) with ``isScratch: false`` even though they are real
scratch orgs (valid ``devHubUsername``, present in ``sf org list`` scratchOrgs).
The SF CLI then rejects scratch-only commands against them with
NonScratchOrgError, e.g.:

* ``sf org create user``        (this repo: the create_personas_sales_rep_user task)
* ``sf org generate password``  (a developer running it manually)

This task reads the org's auth file(s), and when ``isScratch`` is false/missing
*but* a ``devHubUsername`` is present (i.e. it really is a scratch org), flips
``isScratch`` to true and writes the file back atomically (preserving 0600
permissions). It is idempotent (a no-op when the flag is already correct) and
non-fatal by default (warns and continues), so it is safe to run as the first
step of a build flow or standalone.

Usage:
    In cumulusci.yml (as the first step of prepare_core, gated on scratch):
        fix_scratch_org_identity:
            class_path: tasks.rlm_fix_scratch_identity.FixScratchOrgIdentity

    Command line (one-off repair before `sf org create user` etc.):
        cci task run fix_scratch_org_identity --org ent-r1
