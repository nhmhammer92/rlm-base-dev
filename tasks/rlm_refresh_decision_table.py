    # obvious remediation for a stale table (`cci task run refresh_dt_commerce

        Refresh the OAuth token before the task runs.

        ⚠ The flag above buys `--org`, NOT a token refresh. `SFDXBaseTask` descends from
        `Command`, which — unlike `SalesforceCommand` — never sets `salesforce_task`, and
        so inherits `BaseTask._update_credentials`, a bare `pass`. This task builds its
        own `Authorization: Bearer` header from `org_config.access_token`, and
        `_make_request` returns None on any non-2xx, which `_refresh_decision_table` only
        logs — so a token that failed to refresh would mean every table goes unrefreshed
        while the flow step stays green.

        ⚠ Scope that risk honestly rather than restating it as a live danger. CCI wraps
        the sf CLI and leverages its auth, so every org here is an `SfdxOrgConfig` (or its
        `ScratchOrgConfig` subclass), which resolves `access_token` through `sfdx_info` —
        a `sf org display` behind a TTL cache — and is therefore always fresh. The
        stale-token shape needs a plain `OrgConfig` from `cci org connect`, which this
        project does not use; verified against the keychain 2026-07-27, zero plain
        `OrgConfig`. Insurance for the class, not a fix for anything seen here.
