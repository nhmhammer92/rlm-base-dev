# qb-pricing Data Plan

SFDMU data plan for QuantumBit (QB) pricing configuration. Creates pricebook entries, price adjustment schedules/tiers, attribute-based adjustments, bundle-based adjustments, derived prices, cost books, and currency types.

> **SFDMU 5.6.4+ floor.** Seven objects (PriceAdjustmentTier, AttributeAdjustmentCondition, AttributeBasedAdjustment, BundleBasedAdjustment, PricebookEntry, PricebookEntryDerivedPrice, CostBookEntry) use `Insert` — a pre-5.6.4 workaround for relationship-traversal externalId matching, **fixed at/below the 5.6.4 floor**. Idempotency comes from the separate `delete_quantumbit_pricing_data` step that runs first (reverse plan order), **not** `deleteOldData`. Migrating these to `Upsert` is the gated `sfdmu-v5-optimization` initiative — do not flip operations without live verification and explicit approval.

## CCI Integration

### Flow: `prepare_pricing_data`

This plan runs as two steps in the `prepare_pricing_data` flow (when `qb=true`). The delete step runs first to clear all Insert-operation records, enabling idempotent re-runs and support for layered data shapes.

| Step | Task                                | Description                                                |
|------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `delete_quantumbit_pricing_data`    | Deletes all Insert-operation records (shape-agnostic, reverse plan order) |
| 2    | `insert_quantumbit_pricing_data`    | Runs this SFDMU plan                                       |

A separate flow, `prepare_price_adjustment_schedules`, activates PriceAdjustmentSchedule records via Apex on scratch orgs:

| Step | Task                                   | Description                                        |
|------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `activate_price_adjustment_schedules`  | Runs `activatePriceAdjustmentSchedules.apex` (scratch only) |

### Task Definitions

```yaml
delete_quantumbit_pricing_data:
  class_path: tasks.rlm_sfdmu.DeleteSFDMUData
  options:
    pathtoexportjson: "datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pricing"

insert_quantumbit_pricing_data:
  class_path: tasks.rlm_sfdmu.LoadSFDMUData
  options:
    pathtoexportjson: "datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pricing"
```

`DeleteSFDMUData` reads `export.json` at runtime, identifies all non-excluded `operation: Insert` objects, and deletes **all records** of those types in **reverse array order** (children first). No WHERE-clause filtering — shape-agnostic. See `tasks/rlm_sfdmu.py`.

## Data Plan Overview

The plan uses a **delete + insert** pattern across 16 objects. Seven objects use `Insert` (instead of `Upsert`) to work around SFDMU v5 bugs with relationship-traversal externalIds; all seven Insert objects are pre-cleared by `delete_quantumbit_pricing_data` before each load. Three objects are `Readonly` (Product2, ProductSellingModel, AttributeDefinition) — they provide SFDMU with lookup context for parent resolution without modifying them. `ProrationPolicy` uses `Update` (not Upsert) because those records are always pre-provisioned by the platform. `PriceAdjustmentSchedule` uses `Upsert` (ordered before its child adjustments) — there is exactly **one schedule per type** (Attribute / Bundle / Volume), in the corporate currency (USD), matching what the platform seeds; every currency's adjustment children reference that single schedule by `Name` and are disambiguated at pricing time by their own `CurrencyIsoCode`.

```

¹ **Pre-Deleted:** `delete_quantumbit_pricing_data` deletes all records of these types before each load (reverse plan order: CBE → PEDP → PBE → BBA → ABA → AAC → PAT). Pre-5.6.4 workaround for SFDMU v5 Bug 3 — Upsert with relationship-traversal externalId components inserted instead of matching existing records; **fixed in the 5.6.4 release (commit `50be987`)**, retained pending the gated `sfdmu-v5-optimization` migration. (Issue [#781](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SFDX-Data-Move-Utility/issues/781) reported the symptom; the relationship-path fix landed in 5.6.4, not that issue.)

**Other notes:**
- `ProrationPolicy`: `Update` (not Upsert) — records are always pre-provisioned by the platform; SFDMU v5 TARGET SELECT fails for this managed object
- `PriceAdjustmentSchedule`: `Upsert` with `WHERE ContractId = NULL` on the direct-field `Name` externalId, ordered **before** the child adjustments. There is **one schedule per type** (Attribute / Bundle / Volume), USD (corporate) — exactly what the platform seeds, so Upsert matches the seeded rows (no duplicates). Do **not** create per-currency schedule variants: `PriceAdjustmentTier` / `AttributeBasedAdjustment` / `BundleBasedAdjustment` of every currency reference this single schedule by `PriceAdjustmentSchedule.Name` and are disambiguated by their own `CurrencyIsoCode` at pricing time. The pricing procedure pins each adjustment step to one schedule Id via `find_replace` (`… WHERE name = 'Standard …' LIMIT 1`), so duplicating the schedule per currency makes non-USD adjustment lookups resolve nothing
- `CostBook` is ordered before `Pricebook2` — `Pricebook2` has a `CostBookId` FK; processing it first produced `#N/A` in the target result
- `Pricebook2.csv` resolves `CostBookId` through `CostBook.Name` (`Standard Cost Book`) so the standard pricebook links to the seeded cost book deterministically.
- `CostBook` now keys on `Name` only, and `CostBookEntry` references `CostBook.Name` directly for parent resolution.

## Apex Activation Script

**File:** `scripts/apex/activatePriceAdjustmentSchedules.apex`

Activates 5 standard PriceAdjustmentSchedule records by name:
- Standard Attribute Based Adjustment
- Standard Bundle Based Adjustment
- Standard Price Adjustment Tier
- Standard Tier Based Adjustment
- Standard Volume Based Adjustment

This script only runs on **scratch orgs** (gated by `when: org_config.scratch` in the flow).

## Key Object Groups

### Currency and Proration (Objects 1-2)

Currency types (7 currencies: USD, GBP, EUR, AUD, CAD, CHF, JPY) and proration policy.

**Multicurrency:** every currency-scoped object below carries one row per active currency — USD (base) plus GBP, EUR, AUD, CAD, CHF, JPY. Non-USD monetary amounts (`PricebookEntry.UnitPrice`, `CostBookEntry.Cost`, `Override`/`Amount`-type `AttributeBasedAdjustment.AdjustmentValue`) are derived from `CurrencyType.ConversionRate` — refreshed via `cci task run update_currency_rates_csv` — and rounded to the nearest 0.50; JPY is rounded to a whole yen. The converted rows are produced by `scripts/expand_currency_pricing_data.py`; re-run it with `--apply` after a rate refresh to regenerate them (idempotent — it strips and rebuilds every non-USD row from the USD base). Percentage-, formula-, and bound-type values (BundleBasedAdjustment %, PriceAdjustmentTier %, PricebookEntryDerivedPrice formulas) are copied unchanged across currencies. **Price adjustment schedules are NOT per-currency:** there is one `PriceAdjustmentSchedule` per type (Attribute / Bundle / Volume) in USD, exactly what the platform seeds. Every currency's adjustment children reference that single schedule by `PriceAdjustmentSchedule.Name` and are disambiguated at pricing time by their own `CurrencyIsoCode` — the standard adjustment decision tables match on `PriceAdjustmentScheduleId` **and** `CurrencyIsoCode`. Creating per-currency schedule variants breaks non-USD adjustment lookups: the pricing procedure resolves each adjustment step's schedule Id once via `find_replace` (`… WHERE name = 'Standard …' LIMIT 1`), so a GBP quote would search the USD schedule's Id and match nothing. (Confirmed against a live org 2026-07-23.)

### Pricebooks and Entries (Objects 6, 14)

One non-standard pricebook with 1,862 pricebook entries (266 product/selling-model combinations × 7 currencies) mapping products to selling models with unit prices and currency.

### Price Adjustments (Objects 8-9, 10-12, 13)

- **PriceAdjustmentSchedule** (Upsert on `Name`, ordered first): one schedule per type (USD, platform-seeded), shared by every currency's child adjustments
- **PriceAdjustmentTier**: Tier-based pricing rules
- **AttributeBasedAdjRule/Condition/Adjustment**: Rules for attribute-driven price modifications
- **BundleBasedAdjustment**: Bundle-specific pricing adjustments

### Derived Pricing (Object 15)

PricebookEntryDerivedPrice records that compute prices from contributing products via formulas.

### Cost Books (Objects 6, 16)

CostBookEntry covers every SKU with a positive pricebook price. Costs are deterministically generated from the SKU's lowest positive `PricebookEntry.UnitPrice` using a SKU-seeded multiplier between 10% and 50%, so each cost remains below the lowest pricebook price for that SKU.

## Composite External IDs

Several objects use complex multi-field composite keys:

| Object                       | Key Components | CSV `$$` Column |
|------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| ProductSellingModel          | Name + SellingModelType | Yes       |
| Pricebook2                   | Name + IsStandard | Yes            |
| CostBook                     | Name | No (single-field key) |
| PriceAdjustmentTier          | 9-field composite | Yes            |
| PriceAdjustmentSchedule      | Name | No (single-field key) |
| AttributeAdjustmentCondition | 3-field composite | Yes            |
| AttributeBasedAdjustment     | 5-field composite | Yes            |
| BundleBasedAdjustment        | 8-field composite | Yes            |
| PricebookEntry               | 3-field composite | Yes            |
| PricebookEntryDerivedPrice   | 8-field composite | Yes            |
| CostBookEntry                | 3-field composite | Yes            |

Nested `$$` columns are used for parent lookup resolution (e.g., `Pricebook2.$$Name$IsStandard`, `ProductSellingModel.$$Name$SellingModelType`). The child adjustments reference their shared schedule with the simple single-field `PriceAdjustmentSchedule.Name` (not a `$$` composite) — one schedule per type, so `Name` resolves it unambiguously.

## Portability

### PORTABILITY ISSUE: `AttributeBasedAdjRule.Name`

`AttributeBasedAdjRule` uses timestamp-based auto-generated names as its external ID:

```
Rule_1724814105445
Rule_1724814147720
Rule_1724814176583
Rule_1724814263993
```

These names are **not portable** across orgs — they are generated at insert time and will differ between environments. This affects:
- `AttributeBasedAdjRule` itself (externalId: `Name`)
- `AttributeAdjustmentCondition` (externalId includes `AttributeBasedAdjRule.Name`)
- `AttributeBasedAdjustment` (externalId includes `AttributeBasedAdjRule.Name`)

**Recommended fix:** Replace `Name` with a stable, human-readable alternative field, or rename the rules to descriptive values. Needs investigation to determine if `AttributeBasedAdjRule` has a `DeveloperName` or `Code` field that could be used instead.

### Other External IDs

All other external IDs use portable fields:
- `IsoCode` for CurrencyType
- `StockKeepingUnit` for Product2 references
- `Name` for ProrationPolicy, Pricebook2 (human-readable)
- `Code` for AttributeDefinition
- Composite keys built from the above portable fields

## Dependencies

**Upstream:**
- **qb-pcm** — Product2 (SKU), ProductSellingModel (Name;SellingModelType), ProrationPolicy, AttributeDefinition (Code)

**Downstream:**
- None directly — pricing is consumed at runtime by the quoting/ordering engine

## Idempotency

**Org-backed idempotency validated (USD baseline)** — consecutive runs of
`delete_quantumbit_pricing_data` + `insert_quantumbit_pricing_data` were verified
to produce identical record counts on the prior single-currency plan (367 records:
3 PAT, 4 AAC, 4 ABA, 2 BBA, 266 PBE, 2 PEDP, 88 CBE). The delete-then-insert
mechanism is currency-agnostic — it clears all records of each type regardless of
`CurrencyIsoCode` — so the multicurrency expansion keeps the same idempotency
guarantee; the expected steady-state count is now **2,545 records** (21 PAT,
4 AAC, 28 ABA, 14 BBA, 1,862 PBE, 14 PEDP, 616 CBE). ✅ **Live-verified 2026-07-23**
on a scratch org: `delete_quantumbit_pricing_data` + `insert_quantumbit_pricing_data`
ran to `SUCCESS` (exit 0) with **0 failed rows** across every object — including the
single-per-type `PriceAdjustmentSchedule` (3 rows, `Upsert` on `Name`, ordered before
the child adjustments; see *Currency and Proration*), `PriceAdjustmentTier` (21),
`AttributeBasedAdjustment` (28), `BundleBasedAdjustment` (14), `PricebookEntry`
(1,862), and `CostBookEntry` (616). The static SFDMU validator may still
flag extraction-safety issues for relationship traversal fields in this plan;
treat those as follow-up items before relying on extraction round-trips.

The `CostBookEntry` rows are part of the delete-then-insert set. The CSV resolves
the parent CostBook through `CostBook.Name`; this preserves the idempotent load
behavior (now 616 rows across 7 currencies) while avoiding an unnecessary
composite lookup reference to the single seeded CostBook.

The delete-then-insert pattern replaces the previous Upsert approach. `Readonly` objects ensure parent lookup resolution without modification. `Upsert` objects (`CurrencyType`, `CostBook`, `Pricebook2`, `PriceAdjustmentSchedule`, `AttributeBasedAdjRule`) are naturally idempotent via their direct-field externalIds.

**Expected partial failures on orgs with active quotes:**
- `PricebookEntry`: up to 7 records per run may fail deletion ("Products will not be deleted from quote lines") if QuoteLineItems reference them — the records remain and are not re-inserted, causing no count change
- `AttributeAdjustmentCondition`: up to 4 records may show "insufficient access rights on object id" (same cause — QuoteLineItem lock bleed); resolves cleanly on scratch orgs or orgs without active quotes referencing this pricing data

**Note on `PriceAdjustmentSchedule`:** Uses `Upsert` on the direct-field `Name` externalId, ordered **before** the child adjustments. There is **one schedule per type** (Attribute / Bundle / Volume), USD (corporate) — matching what the platform seeds, so Upsert matches the seeded rows (no duplicates). All currencies' tiers/adjustments reference this single schedule by `Name` and are disambiguated by their own `CurrencyIsoCode` at pricing time. Do **not** create per-currency schedule variants — the pricing procedure pins each adjustment step to one schedule Id (`find_replace … LIMIT 1`), so per-currency schedules make non-USD adjustment lookups resolve nothing.

## 260 Schema Analysis (Confirmed via Org Describe)

Schema was queried against a 260 scratch org. Findings below.

### Polymorphic Fields

**None found.** All reference fields on pricing objects are single-target lookups.

### Self-Referencing Fields

**None found.** No pricing objects reference themselves.

| CostBookEntry                | ✅     | All fields present                                  |

### Cross-Object Dependencies

All lookup targets are either included in the plan (as Upsert or Readonly) or exist from upstream plans:

| Lookup Target          | Source Plan | Status     |
|------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Product2               | qb-pcm      | Readonly   |
| ProductSellingModel    | qb-pcm      | Readonly   |
| AttributeDefinition    | qb-pcm      | Readonly   |
| CostBook               | This plan   | Upsert     |
| Pricebook2             | This plan   | Upsert     |
| PriceAdjustmentSchedule| This plan   | Upsert     |
| AttributeBasedAdjRule  | This plan   | Upsert     |
| PricebookEntry         | This plan   | Upsert     |
| Contract               | N/A         | Filtered out via WHERE |

## External ID / Composite Key Analysis (Confirmed via Org Describe)

### Schema-Enforced Unique Fields

No pricing-specific objects have schema-enforced unique fields (`isUnique=true`). All externalIds rely on convention-unique values (human-readable Names, Codes from upstream plans).

### Auto-Numbered Name Fields (Portability Assessment)

| Object                       | Name Auto-Num | Current ExternalId                                     | Assessment |
|------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| PriceAdjustmentTier          | **Yes**       | 9-field composite (PAS.Name + Product.SKU + PSM.Name + ...) | ✅ Good — comprehensive composite |
| AttributeAdjustmentCondition | **Yes**       | `ABR.Name;AttrDef.Code;Product.SKU`                   | ⚠️ Depends on ABR.Name (timestamp) |
| AttributeBasedAdjustment     | **Yes**       | `ABR.Name;PAS.Name;Product.SKU;PSM.Name;Currency`     | ⚠️ Depends on ABR.Name (timestamp) |
| BundleBasedAdjustment        | **Yes**       | 8-field composite                                       | ✅ Good — all parent refs |
| PricebookEntryDerivedPrice   | **Yes**       | 8-field composite                                       | ✅ Good — all parent refs |
| CostBookEntry                | **Yes**       | `CostBook.Name;Product.SKU;CurrencyIsoCode`            | ✅ Good — all parent refs |

### Portability Issue: AttributeBasedAdjRule Name Cascade

`AttributeBasedAdjRule.Name` is **not auto-numbered** but contains **timestamp-based values** (e.g., `Rule_1724814105445`). The schema confirms:
- `Name`: `autoNum=false`, `unique=false`, `idLookup=true`, `updateable=true`
- `UsageType`: only other non-system field (new in 260)

There is **no alternative unique field** — `AttributeBasedAdjRule` has no `Code`, `DeveloperName`, or other candidate. The only fix is to **rename the Name values** to something human-readable and portable (e.g., `GPU-Memory-Size-Rule`, `Storage-Type-Rule`).

This timestamp Name cascades to 2 dependent objects:
- `AttributeAdjustmentCondition.externalId` includes `AttributeBasedAdjRule.Name`
- `AttributeBasedAdjustment.externalId` includes `AttributeBasedAdjRule.Name`

### Composite Key Complexity

| Object                       | Key Fields | Complexity | Simplification? |
|------------------------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| CurrencyType                 | 1 (`IsoCode`) | Simple | No |
| ProrationPolicy              | 1 (`Name`) | Simple | No |
| Pricebook2                   | 2 (`Name;IsStandard`) | Low | No — `Name` alone isn't unique (Standard + custom can share names) |
| CostBook                     | 1 (`Name`) | Low | N/A (already simplified) |
| PriceAdjustmentSchedule      | 1 (`Name`) | Low | N/A (one schedule per type, USD) |
| PriceAdjustmentTier          | **9** fields | **Very High** | Possible — investigate if a subset guarantees uniqueness |
| AttributeBasedAdjustment     | 5 fields | High | No — multi-dimensional adjustment targeting |
| BundleBasedAdjustment        | **8** fields | **Very High** | No — bundle hierarchy requires all dimensions |
| PricebookEntry               | 3 fields | Medium | No — PBE is Product+PSM+Currency |
| PricebookEntryDerivedPrice   | **8** fields | **Very High** | Possible — contributing product may be enough to narrow |
| CostBookEntry                | 3 fields | Medium | No |

**PriceAdjustmentTier** has the most complex key (9 fields). Investigate whether `PriceAdjustmentSchedule.Name;LowerBound;TierType;CurrencyIsoCode` would be sufficient as a simpler unique combination.

## Optimization Opportunities

1. **Fix `AttributeBasedAdjRule` portability**: Rename timestamp-based `Name` values to human-readable names — no alternative unique field exists
2. **Add `UsageType` to `AttributeBasedAdjRule` SOQL**: New 260 field not in current query
3. **Investigate PriceAdjustmentTier key simplification**: Test whether a 4-5 field subset of the 9-field key is sufficient for uniqueness
4. **Investigate PricebookEntryDerivedPrice key simplification**: Test whether fewer fields uniquely identify derived prices
5. **Extraction available**: Use `extract_qb_pricing_data` (Data Management - Extract). Run all extracts: `cci flow run run_qb_extracts --org <org>`. Idempotency: `test_qb_pricing_idempotency` / `cci flow run run_qb_idempotency_tests --org <org>`.
6. **Consider activation flow integration**: The `prepare_price_adjustment_schedules` flow is separate from `prepare_pricing_data` — consider whether they should be combined
7. **Consistency**: Uses `objectSets` wrapper — consider switching to flat `objects` array for consistency with qb-pcm
