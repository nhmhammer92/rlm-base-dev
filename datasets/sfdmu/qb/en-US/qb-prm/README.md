# qb-prm Data Plan

SFDMU data plan for QuantumBit (QB) Partner Relationship Management (PRM). Creates the channel program structure with partner accounts, program levels (tiers), and program memberships with partner-specific discount rates.

> **SFDMU 5.6.4+ floor.** This plan is `Upsert` throughout — no `Insert` / `deleteOldData` workarounds. Its relationship-traversal externalIds match correctly on the 5.6.4+ floor, so there is nothing to migrate.

## CCI Integration

### Flow: `prepare_prm`

This plan is executed as **step 8** of the `prepare_prm` flow (when `prm=true` and `qb=true`).

**Every step is gated by `prm`; several carry additional `when:` conditions in `cumulusci.yml` (shown below), so not all steps run on every org.** The flow also uses non-contiguous numeric step keys (step 4 is intentionally absent).

| Step | Task                              | Extra `when:` (beyond `prm`) | Description |
|------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | `create_partner_central`          | —                            | Create Partner Central community |
| 2    | `patch_network_email_for_deploy`  | `prm_exp_bundle` and `tso`   | Replace placeholder email in rlm.network-meta.xml with Network's actual EmailSenderAddress (immutable) |
| 3    | `deploy_post_prm`                 | `prm_exp_bundle` and `tso`   | Deploy PRM Experience Bundle metadata |
| 5    | `revert_network_email_after_deploy` | `prm_exp_bundle` and `tso` | Restore placeholder email in rlm.network-meta.xml |
| 6    | `publish_community`               | —                            | Publish the Partner Central community |
| 7    | `assign_permission_sets`          | `prm_exp_bundle` and `tso`   | Assign `RLM_PRM` permission set |
| 8    | `insert_quantumbit_prm_data`      | `qb`                         | Runs this SFDMU plan (2-pass) |
| 9    | `manage_context_definition`       | —                            | Activate the PartnerAccount context definition plan |
| 10   | flow: `prepare_prm_pricing`       | `prm_pricing`                | Deploy PRM pricing metadata and data |

> **Note:** steps 2/3/5/7 also require `tso` (Trialforce Source Org), which **defaults to `false`** — so on a default dev/ent scratch build those steps (including `assign_permission_sets`) are **skipped**. This plan (step 8) still runs whenever `prm` and `qb` are true, independent of those steps.

### Task Definition

```yaml
insert_quantumbit_prm_data:
  class_path: tasks.rlm_sfdmu.LoadSFDMUData
  options:
    pathtoexportjson: "datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-prm"
```

## Data Plan Overview

The plan uses a **2-pass SFDMU plan** via `objectSets` (same pattern as qb-billing). Pass 1 creates the Account and program structure. Pass 2 enables `IsPartner` on the Account (not createable via API, only updateable) and links ChannelProgramMember to the partner-enabled Account.

```
Pass 1 — Upsert Accounts and Channel Programs
---------------------------------------------
Account (Upsert) → ChannelProgram (Upsert) →
ChannelProgramLevel (Upsert)

Pass 2 — Enable Partner Accounts and Link Members
--------------------------------------------------
Account (Update IsPartner=true) →
ChannelProgramMember (Upsert)
```

### Objects

| Pass | Object                | Operation | External ID                  | Records |
|------|-----------------------|-----------|------------------------------|---------|
| 1    | Account               | Upsert    | `Name`                       | 1       |
| 1    | ChannelProgram        | Upsert    | `Name`                       | 1       |
| 1    | ChannelProgramLevel   | Upsert    | `Name;Rank`                  | 4       |
| 2    | Account               | Update    | `Name`                       | 1       |
| 2    | ChannelProgramMember  | Upsert    | `Partner.Name;Program.Name`  | 1       |

## Key Design Decisions

### Account — 2-pass IsPartner enablement

`Account.IsPartner` is `createable: false, updateable: true`. On a fresh org, pass 1 inserts the Account (IsPartner is ignored), then pass 2 updates it to `IsPartner=true`. This ensures the Account is partner-enabled before `ChannelProgramMember` links to it via `PartnerId`.

### ChannelProgramLevel (Pass 1)

Uses composite externalId `Name;Rank` — both are direct fields on the object, which ensures SFDMU Upsert correctly matches existing records (avoids SFDMU v5 Bug 3 with relationship-traversal externalIds). Includes custom fields for partner discount management:
- `RLM_Deal_Expiration_Days__c` — deal registration expiration
- `RLM_Discount_Rate__c` — discount percentage for the tier
- `RLM_Minimum_Deal_Size__c` — minimum deal size threshold

### ChannelProgramMember (Pass 2)

Auto-numbered `Name` field (`00000003` format) — not used as externalId. Uses `Partner.Name;Program.Name` composite key instead (a partner can only be enrolled in a program once). Uses `Upsert` with `skipExistingRecords: true` to preserve any existing members not in this plan.

Custom fields carry partner-specific pricing adjustments:
- `RLM_Adjustment_Type__c` — adjustment type (e.g., "Percentage")
- `RLM_Adjustment_Value__c` — adjustment amount
- `RLM_Discount_Rate__c` — partner discount rate

#### Org-Verified Exception: ChannelProgramMember Traversal Key

`ChannelProgramMember` uses `Partner.Name;Program.Name` as its external ID
because the object has no stable direct field that represents the natural
business key for a partner's enrollment in a program. This relationship
traversal is a narrow, org-verified exception to the general SFDMU v5 guidance
to avoid traversal-based Upsert keys.

The current baseline PRM dataset has been validated against target
environments and reruns without increasing the scoped `ChannelProgramMember`
count. No custom external key field is required, and the plan must not switch to
`Insert` + `deleteOldData: true` because that would delete memberships outside
this seed-data scope. Rerun validation remains part of the PR checklist for PRM
changes that touch this plan or its `ChannelProgramMember` records.

## Custom Fields and Permission Set

### Custom Field Metadata

Custom fields are packaged under `unpackaged/post_prm/force-app/main/default/objects/`
and deployed by the baseline `deploy_post_prm` task:

| Object                | Field                          | Type          | Label                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| ChannelProgramLevel   | `RLM_Deal_Expiration_Days__c`  | Number(18,0)  | Deal Expiration Days |
| ChannelProgramLevel   | `RLM_Discount_Rate__c`         | Number(18,0)  | Discount Rate ¹      |
| ChannelProgramLevel   | `RLM_Minimum_Deal_Size__c`     | Currency(18,0)| Minimum Deal Size    |
| ChannelProgramMember  | `RLM_Adjustment_Type__c`       | Text(255)     | Adjustment Type      |
| ChannelProgramMember  | `RLM_Adjustment_Value__c`      | Number(18,2)  | Adjustment Value     |
| ChannelProgramMember  | `RLM_Discount_Rate__c`         | Number(18,2)  | Discount Rate        |

¹ `ChannelProgramLevel.RLM_Discount_Rate__c` was intentionally changed from `Percent(18,0)` to `Number(18,0)` in this feature branch to align with the PRM pricing bundle. The field holds the rate as a literal whole number (the seed values are `15`, `10`, `5`, `2` — i.e. `15` means a 15% discount), which the PRM pricing decision table (`RLM_Channel_Program_Level_Partner`) reads directly. A `Percent` field would be treated as a fraction (e.g. `0.15`) in formula/decision-table evaluation, so `Number` keeps the stored and evaluated values identical. Because this repo targets clean org builds, no destructive migration of existing data is required.

### Permission Set: `RLM_PRM`

Grants full read/edit access to all 6 custom fields above. When it runs, step 7 (`assign_permission_sets`) assigns it before the data load so SFDMU can write the custom fields. Note step 7 is **conditional** — it only runs when `prm_exp_bundle` and `tso` are both true (see the flow table), so on a default `tso=false` build the assignment does not happen in this flow and `RLM_PRM` must already be granted to the automation user by another path for the load to write the custom fields.

## Composite External IDs

| Object                | Composite Key             | CSV `$$` Column   | Bug 3 Risk |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|------------|
| ChannelProgramLevel   | `Name;Rank`               | `$$Name$Rank`      | No — direct fields |
| ChannelProgramMember  | `Partner.Name;Program.Name` | `$$Partner.Name$Program.Name` | Org-verified exception |

## Portability

All external IDs use portable, human-readable fields:
- **Account.Name**: "Robot Resellers" — descriptive, stable
- **ChannelProgram.Name**: "Reseller Program" — descriptive, stable
- **ChannelProgramLevel**: `Name` + `Rank` — descriptive, stable
- **ChannelProgramMember**: Identified by parent traversals (Partner.Name + Program.Name)

No auto-numbered Name fields are used as external IDs.

## Dependencies

This plan has **no upstream data plan dependencies** — it creates its own Account records.

This plan is independent of the product catalog (qb-pcm) and can be loaded in any order relative to other QB plans. Within the `prepare_prm` flow, metadata deployment, community setup, and permission assignment (steps 1-7) run before this data load (step 8) **when their `when:` conditions are met** — steps 2/3/5/7 require `prm_exp_bundle` and `tso`, so on a default `tso=false` build several are skipped (see the flow table above). The data load itself (step 8) runs whenever `prm` and `qb` are true.

## Extraction

```bash
cci task run extract_qb_prm_data --org <your-org>
```

## Idempotency

```bash
cci task run test_qb_prm_idempotency --org <your-org>
```

Account, ChannelProgram, and ChannelProgramLevel are fully idempotent via
Upsert on direct fields. `ChannelProgramMember` is the org-verified exception
described above and must continue to pass rerun validation before merge.
