# qb-billing Data Plan

SFDMU data plan for QuantumBit (QB) billing configuration. Creates accounting periods, legal entity accounting period mappings, payment terms, billing policies/treatments/items, general ledger accounts, GL assignment rules, sequence policies with selection conditions, and assigns billing policies to products. LegalEntity is owned by qb-tax (runs first) and resolved here as Readonly. Uses a 3-pass architecture with Apex activation for complex dependency ordering.

## CCI Integration

### Flow: `prepare_billing`

This plan is executed as **step 1** of the `prepare_billing` flow (when `billing=true`, `qb=true`, `refresh=false`).

| Step | Task                                    | When               | Description                                                                             |
|------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `deploy_post_billing`                   | billing            | Deploys billing settings/metadata from `unpackaged/post_billing` — **must run first** to enable `SequenceService` and `BillingSettings` so SequencePolicy SObjects are accessible |
| 2    | `insert_billing_data`                   | billing+qb         | Runs this SFDMU plan (3 passes)                                                         |
| 3    | `insert_q3_billing_data`                | billing+q3         | Loads Q3 billing data (gated by q3 flag)                                                |
| 4    | `create_sequence_policies`              | billing+qb+!refresh| Creates `SequencePolicy` and `SeqPolicySelectionCondition` records via the Connect API (standard DML cannot create these objects) |
| 5    | `activate_flow`                         | billing            | Activates `RLM_Order_to_Billing_Schedule_Flow`                                          |
| 6    | `activate_default_payment_term`         | billing            | Runs `activateDefaultPaymentTerm.apex`                                                  |
| 7    | `activate_billing_records`              | billing            | Runs `activateBillingRecords.apex` (BTI → BT → BP)                                     |
| 8    | `enable_timeline`                       | billing_ui+!tso    | Enables industries_common:timeline (required before billing_ui flexipages). Skipped on TSO builds (Timeline enabled via metadata). |
| 9    | `deploy_billing_id_settings`            | billing            | Deploys `post_billing_id_settings` — sets GL accounts, legal entity, treatment, tax IDs |
| 10   | `deploy_billing_template_settings`      | billing            | Re-enables Invoice Email/PDF toggles (cycled off in step 9 to avoid template ID errors) |
| 11   | `deploy_post_billing_ui`                | billing_ui         | Deploys Billing UI LWC components, Apex, fields, permset from `unpackaged/post_billing_ui` |
| 12   | `assign_permission_sets`                | billing_ui         | Assigns `RLM_BillingUI` permission set to the running user                              |
| 13   | `apply_context_billing_order`           | billing+billing_ui | Patches `RLM_BillingContext` Order node — maps `BillingArrangement__std` → `RLM_Billing_Arrangement__c` and `BillingProfile__std` → `RLM_Billing_Profile__c` |

### Task Definition

```yaml
insert_billing_data:
  class_path: tasks.rlm_sfdmu.LoadSFDMUData
  options:
    pathtoexportjson: "datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-billing"
```

## Data Plan Overview

The plan uses **3 SFDMU passes** followed by **Apex activation**:

```
Pass 1 (SFDMU)           Pass 2 (SFDMU)          Pass 3 (SFDMU)           Apex Activation
──────────────────       ─────────────────       ─────────────────        ─────────────────
Insert all objects  ->   Activate BTI        ->  Activate BT          ->  activateDefaultPaymentTerm.apex
in Draft status          (BillingTreatmentItem)  + set BillingPolicy       activateBillingRecords.apex
+ assign BillingPolicy                            DefaultBillingTreatment  (BTI -> BT -> BP activation)
to Product2
```

### Pass 1 — Insert/Upsert with Draft Status

| #  | Object                       | Operation | External ID                                | Records |
|----|------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1  | AccountingPeriod             | Upsert    | `Name;FinancialYear`                       | 84      |
| 2  | LegalEntity                  | Readonly  | `Name`                                     | 7       |
| 3  | LegalEntyAccountingPeriod    | Upsert    | `Name`                                     | 588     |
| 4  | PaymentTerm                  | Upsert    | `Name`                                     | 2       |
| 5  | PaymentTermItem              | Upsert    | `PaymentTerm.Name;Type`                    | 2       |
| 6  | BillingPolicy                | Upsert    | `Name`                                     | 3       |
| 7  | BillingTreatment             | Upsert    | `Name`                                     | 15      |
| 8  | BillingTreatmentItem         | Upsert    | `Name;BillingTreatment.Name`               | 18      |
| 9  | Product2                     | Update    | `StockKeepingUnit`                         | 316     |
| 10 | GeneralLedgerAccount         | Upsert    | `AccountingCode`                           | 51      |
| 11 | GeneralLedgerAcctAsgntRule   | Upsert    | `Name`                                     | 8       |
| 12 | PaymentRetryRuleSet          | Upsert    | `Name`                                     | 1       |
| 13 | PaymentRetryRule             | Upsert    | `PaymentGatewayErrorCategory;PaymentRetryRuleSet.Name;RetryIntervalType` | 6 |

**Note:** `SequencePolicy` and `SeqPolicySelectionCondition` are **not** SFDMU objects in this plan. They are created by the `create_sequence_policies` Connect-API task (`prepare_billing` step 4), because standard DML cannot create these SObjects. See [Sequence Policies](#sequence-policies-connect-api) below.

**Note:** PaymentTerm, PaymentTermItem, BillingPolicy, BillingTreatment, and BillingTreatmentItem all use `skipExistingRecords: true` to avoid overwriting existing records. Product2 is Update-only (sets `BillingPolicyId`). LegalEntity uses `Readonly` — records are created by qb-tax (which runs first at step 12); qb-billing only resolves their IDs for FK relationships. See [Optimization Opportunities](#optimization-opportunities) for known issues with `skipExistingRecords`.

**Multicurrency billing (regional):** BillingTreatment/BillingTreatmentItem now provide Advance + Arrears treatments for all seven currency regions (USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CHF, JPY), each bound to its `LegalEntity` and the shared, LegalEntity-selecting `Billing Policy - Advance` / `Billing Policy - Arrears` (no new billing policies required). The Canada treatments/items were corrected from USD to CAD. The `Milestone Billing Treatment` stays USD/region-less. ⚠️ Two live-org caveats: (1) the Canada USD→CAD correction applies only on a **fresh** org build and **cannot be back-applied by re-running the plan** on an org that already activated the USD records. `skipExistingRecords: true` skips them, and a targeted update is blocked by the platform itself: `BillingTreatment.CurrencyIsoCode` is locked once `Status=Active` (*"Can't edit Currency ISO Code when status is Active"* — live-verified), and `BillingTreatmentItem.CurrencyIsoCode` is **not updateable at all** (create-only, inherited from the treatment — `Field is not writeable` on any update). Correcting an already-activated org therefore requires rebuilding the billing treatments (delete + reload), i.e. a fresh build — consistent with this repo's fresh-build delivery model. (2) `GeneralLedgerAccount` records remain US-only (as they already were for EU/UK), so end-to-end invoice posting for the new regions needs regional GL accounts added separately. Verify on a live scratch org.

**FK ID pattern:** All parent-lookup fields include both the FK ID field (e.g. `PaymentTermId`, `BillingTreatmentId`, `BillingPolicyId`, `LegalEntityId`) in the SOQL SELECT and the traversal column (e.g. `PaymentTerm.Name`, `BillingTreatment.Name`) in the CSV header. SFDMU v5 requires the FK ID in the SELECT to know which field to write; the traversal column in the CSV provides the lookup value. Omitting the FK ID results in null FKs even when the traversal column resolves correctly.

### Pass 2 — Activate BillingTreatmentItem

| # | Object              | Operation | External ID                    | Records |
|---|---------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|---------|
| 1 | BillingTreatmentItem| Update    | `Name;BillingTreatment.Name`   | (Draft) |

Activates BillingTreatmentItem records that are still in Draft status.

### Pass 3 — Activate BillingTreatment and Set BillingPolicy Defaults

| # | Object           | Operation | External ID | Records |
|---|------------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | BillingTreatment | Update    | `Name`      | (Draft) |
| 2 | BillingPolicy    | Update    | `Name`      | (Draft) |

Activates BillingTreatment records and sets `DefaultBillingTreatmentId` on BillingPolicy. BillingPolicy.csv includes a `DefaultBillingTreatment.Name` traversal column so SFDMU can resolve the FK at load time.

## Sequence Policies (Connect API)

### `create_sequence_policies`

`SequencePolicy` and `SeqPolicySelectionCondition` records are **not** loaded by this SFDMU plan — standard DML cannot create them. Instead, the `create_sequence_policies` task (`tasks.rlm_billing.CreateSequencePolicies`) creates them via the Connect API as **step 4** of `prepare_billing`, reading the policy definitions from `SequencePolicies.json`.

The legacy `resolveSeqPolicyConditionRefs.apex` (which resolved portable LegalEntity names in `SeqPolicySelectionCondition.FilterValue` to target-org IDs) is **retired** — selection conditions are now created directly by the Connect-API task, so no name→ID FilterValue resolution step is wired into `prepare_billing`. The `.apex` file remains on disk but is unused.

## Apex Activation Scripts

### `activateDefaultPaymentTerm.apex`

Activates payment terms in order:
1. Activate "Default Payment Term" and set `IsDefault = true`
2. Activate all remaining Draft PaymentTerm records

### `activateBillingRecords.apex`

Activates billing records in strict dependency order:
1. **BillingTreatmentItem** -> `Status = 'Active'` (all non-Active)
2. **BillingTreatment** -> `Status = 'Active'` (only those with at least one Active BTI)
3. **BillingPolicy** -> `Status = 'Active'` (only when DefaultBillingTreatment is Active and belongs to this policy)

Both scripts are idempotent — all queries filter on non-Active status.

## Configuration

### Notable Settings

- **`excludeIdsFromCSVFiles: "true"`** — Portable, no raw Salesforce IDs in CSVs
- **`useSeparatedCSVFiles: true`** — SFDMU uses `objectset_source/` subdirectories for pass-specific CSV overrides
- **`skipExistingRecords: true`** on billing objects — prevents overwriting existing billing config
- **`BillingTreatment.CanChangeBillingFrequency: true`** on all 15 treatments — see below

### `CanChangeBillingFrequency` gates quote-line creation

`BillingFrequency` is **mandatory** on any quote or order line whose selling model
is `TermDefined` or `Evergreen`:

```
When the SellingModelType is Evergreen or Term-Defined, BillingFrequency can't be null
```

…but the platform only lets you set it when the line's `BillingTreatment` has
`CanChangeBillingFrequency = true`:

```
Update the Billing Treatment "<name>" to make sure that you can change the
Billing Frequency of its related Quote Line Item, and try again.
```

With the flag `false` these two rules deadlock: the frequency cannot be left
null and cannot be set, so **no line can be created for a TermDefined product**
by any route — direct DML *or* the Place Sales Transaction API. Nothing supplies
a default: neither `BillingPolicy` nor `BillingTreatmentItem` carries a billing
frequency to fall back on.

The line also needs an explicit `BillingTreatmentId`; the reference **and** the
flag are both required. Omitting the reference produces the *"Add a Billing
Treatment…"* variant of the same error.

This is why every treatment ships with the flag enabled. It is exercised by
`scripts/build_quote_to_asset.py`, which builds a backdated quote → order →
asset chain for usage-rating tests.

## Key Object Groups

### Financial Infrastructure (Objects 1-3)

AccountingPeriod (84 monthly periods for 2024-2030), LegalEntity (7 entities: US, Canada, EU/France, UK/London, Australia, Switzerland, Japan — resolved as Readonly from qb-tax), and their mapping via LegalEntyAccountingPeriod (588 records = 84 periods × 7 entities).

### Payment Terms (Objects 4-5)

PaymentTerm records with PaymentTermItem definitions (linked via `$$PaymentTerm.Name$Type` composite key).

### Billing Policy Chain (Objects 6-8)

Three-level hierarchy: BillingPolicy -> BillingTreatment -> BillingTreatmentItem. The activation requires strict bottom-up ordering (BTI first, then BT, then BP with default treatment set).

### General Ledger (Objects 10-11)

Chart of accounts (51 GL accounts) with 8 assignment rules mapping transaction types to debit/credit accounts per legal entity.

### Sequence Policies (Connect-API task, not SFDMU)

14 `SequencePolicy` records (7 regions US/CA/EU/UK/AU/CH/JP × Invoice/CreditMemo) controlling invoice and credit memo number sequences, each with one `SeqPolicySelectionCondition` routing by LegalEntity. These are created by the `create_sequence_policies` Connect-API task (`prepare_billing` step 4) from `SequencePolicies.json`, **not** by this SFDMU plan — see [Sequence Policies (Connect API)](#sequence-policies-connect-api).

## Composite External IDs

| Object                      | Composite Key                                                            | CSV `$$` Column |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| AccountingPeriod            | `Name;FinancialYear`                                                     | Yes             |
| PaymentTermItem             | `PaymentTerm.Name;Type`                                                  | Yes             |
| BillingTreatmentItem        | `Name;BillingTreatment.Name`                                             | Yes             |
| PaymentRetryRule            | `PaymentGatewayErrorCategory;PaymentRetryRuleSet.Name;RetryIntervalType` | Yes             |

GL assignment rules reference debit/credit accounts via `DebitGeneralLedgerAccount.AccountingCode` and `CreditGeneralLedgerAccount.AccountingCode` traversal columns in the CSV (resolved to `CreditGeneralLedgerAccountId`/`DebitGeneralLedgerAccountId` FK IDs in SELECT).

## Portability

All external IDs use portable, human-readable fields:

- **Name** fields: All human-readable (e.g., "Default Legal Entity - US", "Default Payment Term", "Billing Treatment Item - Advance - USA", "1100 Accounts Receivable - Trade")
- **LegalEntyAccountingPeriod.Name**: Descriptive composite strings (e.g., "Default Legal Entity - US-2024-January1-January31")
- **StockKeepingUnit** for Product2 references
- **No auto-numbered Name fields**

## Billing Context Plan (`apply_context_billing_order`)

Step 13 of `prepare_billing` patches the `RLM_BillingContext` context definition using the plan at `datasets/context_plans/Billing/contexts/billing_order_attributes.json`. It adds two attribute mappings to the `OrderEntitiesMapping` mapping on the `BillingTransaction` node:

| Context Attribute         | sObject | sObjectField               | Purpose |
|---------------------------|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| `BillingArrangement__std` | Order   | `RLM_Billing_Arrangement__c` | Maps billing arrangement lookup from Order to BillingTransaction context |
| `BillingProfile__std`     | Order   | `RLM_Billing_Profile__c`    | Maps billing profile lookup from Order to BillingTransaction context |

**Notes:**
- `SavedPaymentMethod__std` is intentionally excluded — the platform already has an inherited mapping for this attribute; adding a custom one fails with `INVALID_INPUT: An Inherited mapping for ContextAttribute: SavedPaymentMethod already exists.`
- Task verification logs `hasHydrationDetail: false` for both `__std` attributes — this is a **known false negative**. The Connect API GET does not expose hydration records for `__std` attributes in `contextAttrHydrationDetailList`; the records exist and are confirmed via Tooling API.
- Step 12 is gated by `billing AND billing_ui` because `RLM_Billing_Arrangement__c` and `RLM_Billing_Profile__c` are Order fields deployed by `post_billing_ui` (step 10).

## Dependencies

**Upstream:**
- **qb-pcm** — Product2 records must exist (matched by `StockKeepingUnit`)
- **qb-tax** — LegalEntity records; qb-tax is the authoritative source (runs first at step 12 of `prepare_rlm_org`); qb-billing resolves LegalEntity as `Readonly` only

**Downstream:**
- **qb-rating** — UsageResourceBillingPolicy may reference billing infrastructure
- Runtime billing/invoicing engine consumes this configuration

## Idempotency

Pass 1 uses `skipExistingRecords: true` on billing objects, so re-runs will skip existing records. Passes 2 and 3 update Status and DefaultBillingTreatment fields with `WHERE Status = 'Draft'` filters, so they are no-ops on already-activated records.

The Apex activation scripts filter on `Status != 'Active'`, making them idempotent.

**Validated** — `test_qb_billing_idempotency` passes on Release 260. Pass 1 has 13 objects (12 idempotent; LegalEntity is Readonly).

## 260 Schema Analysis (Confirmed via Org Describe)

Schema was queried against a 260 scratch org. Findings below.

### Polymorphic Fields

**None found.** All reference fields on billing objects are single-target lookups.

### Self-Referencing Fields

**None found.** No billing objects reference themselves.

### New Fields Found in 260 (Not in Current SOQL)

| Object                     | Field                       | Type     | Updateable | Notes                                           |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **BillingTreatment**       | `CanChangeBillingFrequency` | BOOLEAN  | Yes        | Allows billing frequency changes post-creation — **added to plan** |
| **LegalEntyAccountingPeriod** | `ClosureStage`           | PICKLIST | Yes        | Accounting period closure tracking               |

### Field Coverage Audit

| Object                     | Status | Notes                                                        |
|----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| AccountingPeriod           | ✅     | All 5 key fields present; `Total*Amount` fields omitted (zero for new orgs) |
| LegalEntity                | ⚠️     | Same missing fields as qb-tax (email, geo) — see qb-tax README |
| LegalEntyAccountingPeriod  | ⚠️     | Minor: `ClosureStage` not in SOQL (low priority)             |
| PaymentTerm                | ✅     | All 4 fields present                                         |
| PaymentTermItem            | ✅     | All fields present                                           |
| BillingPolicy              | ✅     | All fields present (including DefaultBillingTreatmentId in Pass 3) |
| BillingTreatment           | ✅     | `CanChangeBillingFrequency` added                            |
| BillingTreatmentItem       | ✅     | All fields present; `Handling0Amount` confirmed valid in 260  |
| Product2                   | ✅     | Only updates BillingPolicyId — correct for this plan         |
| GeneralLedgerAccount       | ✅     | All fields present                                           |
| GeneralLedgerAcctAsgntRule | ✅     | All fields present                                           |

### Impact Assessment

- **`BillingTreatment.CanChangeBillingFrequency`**: New boolean controlling whether the billing frequency can be changed after creation. **Medium priority** — affects billing flexibility configuration. Default is likely `false`, so existing data loads may work without it, but extractions from orgs where this is `true` would lose the value.
- **`LegalEntyAccountingPeriod.ClosureStage`**: Controls the closure tracking stage for legal entity accounting periods. **Low priority** — only relevant when period-end close processes are configured.

## Large-deal billing — known limitation with `LegalEntity` treatment selection

`BillingPolicy.BillingTreatmentSelection = LegalEntity` (used by
"Billing Policy - Advance" and other region-keyed policies here) does **not**
resolve reliably for large-deal orders (`IsLargeDeal = true`) at high line counts
during preprocess (`preProcessSalesTransaction` / `resolveBillingTreatments`). A
`Default`-selection billing policy resolves the same order cleanly because it
reads `DefaultBillingTreatmentId` directly.

**Guidance for large-deal demos/tests:** assign products to a `Default`-selection
billing policy (a large-deal order targets a single legal entity anyway).

**Automated workaround (large_stx builds).** When `large_stx` + `billing` are on,
`prepare_large_stx` runs `seed_large_deal_billing_treatment`
(`scripts/apex/seedLargeDealBillingTreatment.apex`), which seeds a
`Default`-selection **`RLM Large Deal Policy`** + an `ExcludeFromBilling = Yes`
treatment **`RLM Large Deal - Exclude from Billing`** (no legal entity, no
treatment items — nonbillable treatments can't have items). At activation, the
"Prepare for Activation" action (`RLM_PreProcessOrderController.startPreprocess`)
stamps that treatment onto every unresolved `OrderItem.BillingTreatmentId` before
invoking `preProcessSalesTransaction`, so billing-treatment resolution is a no-op
for large deals. Standard orders (`IsLargeDeal = false`) are untouched.

## Optimization Opportunities

1. **Simplify activation**: The 3-pass SFDMU activation + 2 Apex activation scripts is complex — consider whether the Apex scripts alone could handle all activation, reducing to a simpler 1-pass SFDMU plan
2. **LegalEntity field gap**: Same missing geo/email fields as qb-tax — coordinate update across both plans
3. **Investigate `skipExistingRecords` behavior**: PaymentTerm, PaymentTermItem, BillingPolicy, BillingTreatment, and BillingTreatmentItem use `skipExistingRecords: true`. This prevents overwriting existing records but may silently skip new records added to the CSV if any existing record is already present. The exact SFDMU v5 behavior of `skipExistingRecords` — whether it skips the entire object or only matched records — needs verification. If it skips the whole object when any record exists, new CSV rows will never load after initial install.
