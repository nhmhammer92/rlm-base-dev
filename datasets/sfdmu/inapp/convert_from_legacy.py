"""
One-shot converter: Industries In-App Framework legacy CCI dataset -> SFDMU v5 CSVs.

TEMPORARY tooling for the temporary `inapp` integration. Reads the legacy SQLite
dump (`rlm.dataset.sql`) from the Industries-In-App-Framework repo and emits the six
CSVs for datasets/sfdmu/inapp/, applying the composite-key conversion and the scrub
documented in this plan's README.

Transformations:
  1. lookups (legacy row-ids) -> parent `Name` via `<rel>__r.Name` columns
  2. RecordTypeId -> RecordType.DeveloperName via the legacy `*_rt_mapping` tables
  3. booleans True/False -> true/false
  4. SCRUB: drop 2 dead unreferenced blocks + 2 orphan junction rows
  5. REMAP: demo Account 'Mahesh' -> rlm-base-dev default account 'Infinitech'
     (QuantumBit primary customer); ACC_MAHESH_DYN_LINK token + DynamicLink Name/Identity
     renamed in lockstep
  6. SCRUB: neutralize 15 dead rich-text images hosted on the source learning org

Usage:
  python datasets/sfdmu/inapp/convert_from_legacy.py [path/to/rlm.dataset.sql]
