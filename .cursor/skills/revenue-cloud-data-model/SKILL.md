# Revenue Cloud Data Model

Revenue Cloud v67.0 (Summer '26 / Release 262) — **263 objects, 4,190 platform fields, 674 relationships** across 9 domains.

The ERD reflects **canonical Revenue Cloud platform schema only**. Custom fields (any `__c` suffix, including project-deployed `RLM_*__c` and managed-package fields) are excluded by validation tooling so the schema stays platform-pure.

**Verified 2026-05-27 against:**
- 260 baseline scratch org `ent-r1` (Spring '26, API v66)
- 262 target scratch org `rlm-base__ent-sb0` (Summer '26, API v67)
- Core UDD source at `gitcore.soma.salesforce.com/core-2206/core-262-public@p4/262-patch`
- 127 entities individually verified against canonical entity XMLs

**260 → 262 delta:** **Field-level additive** (45 fields added, 0 removed, 0 type changes, 2 polymorphic-reference targets expanded — e.g. `Invoice.ReferenceEntityId` now also accepts `Opportunity`/`Quote`) with **value-level picklist deltas** of 243 added and 62 removed. The 62 picklist removals are IANA TimeZone renames on datetime-zone fields plus cleanup of unused industry-specific `UsageType` values (`InsuranceRuleAction`, `StageManagement`) on fulfillment objects and a few miscellaneous values. Every removed value was cross-referenced against every CSV under `datasets/sfdmu/{qb,q3,mfg}/**` — **zero maintained-plan rows reference any removed value**. Nine objects with deltas appear in existing SFDMU plans per `scripts/erd/schema_diff/260-vs-262-diff.md` `--impact` output, but **no SFDMU remediation is required**: additive fields cannot break existing CSV imports, and the removed picklist values aren't in use. Full diff at `scripts/erd/schema_diff/260-vs-262-diff.md`.

**Common misconceptions resolved (DO NOT propagate):**
- The Revenue Cloud "PUG" entity is `ProductUsageGrant`, NOT `ProductUsageGroup` (which doesn't exist in core source)
- `RateCard.Status` does not exist in any Salesforce release. The Status field is on `RateCardEntry` (slot=10, identical 260 vs 262)
- The 262 `RateCardEntry` SOAP DML failure (#262-2) is a runtime platform regression, not a schema change
- The 262 PUR overlap validation enforcement (#262-4) is runtime-gated, not a schema/validator code change

## Quick Rules

1. Use `scripts/ai/query_erd.py` to query object details on demand.
2. Load per-domain files (e.g., `domains/pricing.md`) for detailed field/relationship info.
3. Cross-domain FKs are documented in `cross-domain-relationships.md`.
4. Product2 is the central object — most domains reference it.
5. Standard fields often have API names without `__c` suffix.
6. To validate ERD against an org or refresh from a new release, see `.cursor/skills/schema-validation/SKILL.md`.
7. Custom fields are NOT in the ERD by design. To verify a `__c` field exists, query the org directly with `sf sobject describe`.

## Domain Overview

## Central Object: Product2

`Product2` is the hub of the entire Revenue Cloud data model. Nearly every domain connects back to it:

- **PCM**: ProductAttributeDefinition, ProductCategoryProduct, ProductRelatedComponent, ProductSellingModelOption all reference Product2
- **Pricing**: PriceBookEntry, PriceAdjustmentTier, BundleBasedAdjustment link products to price books and adjustments
- **Rates**: RateCardEntry links Product2 to rate cards via UsageResource
- **Configurator**: ProductConfigurationFlow and ProductConfigurationRule bind to Product2
- **Transactions**: QuoteLineItem, OrderItem, Asset, FulfillmentOrderLineItem, InvoiceLine all carry Product2Id
- **Usage**: ProductUsageResource (PUR) binds Product2 to UsageResource; ProductUsageGrant (PUG) grants usage entitlements per product
- **Billing**: Product2 carries BillingPolicyId, TaxPolicyId — set by billing/tax data plans
- **DRO**: ProductFulfillmentDecompRule and ProductFulfillmentScenario reference Product2

    Quote → QuoteLineItem
        ↓ (Place Order)
    Order → OrderItem
        ↓ (Asset Creation)
    Asset → AssetStatePeriod, AssetAction → AssetActionSource
        ↓ (Fulfillment)
    FulfillmentOrder → FulfillmentOrderLineItem

## Querying the Data Model

Use `scripts/ai/query_erd.py` for targeted lookups against the full 263-object schema:

```bash
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py describe Product2         # fields, relationships, domain
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py relationships Product2     # all objects linked to/from Product2
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py domain Billing             # all objects in a domain
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py path Product2 Invoice      # relationship path between two objects
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py search "usage"             # fuzzy object/field search
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py stats                      # domain counts summary
```

For live org introspection, use the Salesforce DX MCP `run_soql_query` tool.

## Source Data

- `docs/erds/erd-data.json` — canonical machine-readable schema (263 objects, 4,190 fields, 674 relationships, custom fields excluded)
- `docs/erds/*.mermaid` — per-domain ERD diagrams
- `docs/erds/revenue-cloud-erd.html` — interactive force-directed graph viewer
- `docs/erds/validation-report.md` — most recent ERD vs org schema gap analysis; records the **expected** feature-gated baseline (9 objects unfindable in a default RLM scratch profile, 33 objects with cross-cloud / version-gated field gaps, 822 ERD-side fields verified against Core UDD source but absent from a stock org). Use this file as the diff target for new validation runs — a clean refresh produces zero NEW gaps vs this baseline, not zero gaps absolute.
- `scripts/erd/schema_diff/{260,262}-schema.json` — fresh-org schema snapshots for 260 and 262
- `scripts/erd/schema_diff/260-vs-262-diff.md` — verified release delta

Internal-only (not committed; intentionally git-ignored):
- `.agents/artifacts/orphan-field-ownership.json` — per-entity ownership classification for 127 verified entities (used by the `orphan_batch_helper.py` workflow; not required to audit any claim in this skill).
- `docs/erds/orphan-candidates-after-batch*.md` — per-batch orphan classification reports produced by the cleanup workflow. The final outcome of the cleanup is already baked into `erd-data.json` and `validation-report.md`; the intermediate batch reports are local artifacts only.
