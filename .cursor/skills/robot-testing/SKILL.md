# Robot Framework Testing

Use this skill when writing, modifying, or debugging Robot Framework tests.

## Quick Rules

1. `tests/setup/` = **org configuration automation** (not tests). `tests/e2e/` = **functional tests**.
2. Setup tests run mid-flow to toggle settings with no API equivalent. E2E tests run after provisioning.
3. No `//` comments in JavaScript blocks — Robot joins continuation lines, breaking everything after `//`.
4. Use `composed: true` on dispatched events to cross shadow DOM boundaries.
5. Use `self.org_config.username` in Python wrappers for `sf org open -o`.
6. Gate E2E tests with `Skip If "${QB}" == "false"` on the relevant feature flag.
7. For Setup UI + shadow DOM vs iframe: read `setup-ui-shadow-dom.md` before adding new keywords (LWS, `composed`, VF frames).
8. **Live-org verification is mandatory** for any behavioral change to a `.robot` suite or its Python wrapper — `robot --dryrun` is syntax-only and does **not** prove UI/shadow-DOM logic works. See **DO NOT** and **Verification — dryrun is not enough** below.

## DO NOT

- **DO NOT** use `//` comments in Robot JavaScript — use `/* */` instead
- **DO NOT** use standard `input_text` for LWC inputs — use native setter pattern
- **DO NOT** log session tokens — wrap URL retrieval with `Set Log Level NONE`
- **DO NOT** commit a behavioral robot change (keywords, locators, `Execute JavaScript`/DOM logic, click targets, wait/assert flow) **or** its Python task wrapper as verified — or merge it — on `robot --dryrun` alone. Run the affected suite against a live scratch org first. Dryrun never launches a browser. Exempt: comment/`[Documentation]`-only edits, and resource files with no behavioral change.

## Verification — dryrun is not enough

`robot --dryrun` resolves keyword names, argument counts, and syntax. It does
**not** launch a browser, load a Salesforce page, or execute `Execute JavaScript`
blocks. A wrong DOM/shadow-root assumption passes dryrun and then fails mid-build
during `prepare_rlm_org` — after a full scratch-org spin-up, the most expensive
place to discover it.

**Before committing a behavioral robot change** (new/changed keyword, locator,
JS, click target, wait/assert flow) or a change to the Python task that runs a
suite, run it against a live scratch org:

```bash
# via the CCI task wrapper (preferred — mirrors how prepare_rlm_org runs it)
cci task run <robot_task> --org <cci_alias>           # CCI alias, e.g. beta
# or directly against a suite — ORG_ALIAS is passed to `sf org open -o`, so it
# takes the SF CLI alias (or username), NOT the CCI alias
robot -v ORG_ALIAS:<sf_alias> robot/rlm-base/tests/setup/<suite>.robot   # e.g. rlm-base__beta
```

The two commands take **different** alias forms (see AGENTS.md → *Org Identity:
CCI vs SF CLI*): `cci task run --org` uses the CCI alias (`beta`); the direct
`robot` run's `ORG_ALIAS` feeds `sf org open`, so it needs the SF CLI alias
(`rlm-base__beta`) or the org username.

Confirm the suite actually passes (toggle flips, pill/value reads back, element
is found) — not just that it parses. **Exempt:** comment/`[Documentation]`-only
edits and resource files with no behavioral change. When you cannot run a live
org, state that explicitly and mark the change **unverified** (PR label
`blocked: needs-live-verification`) — never present a dryrun as verification.

## Two Purposes: Setup vs E2E

| Aspect | Setup Tests | E2E Tests |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Location | `tests/setup/` | `tests/e2e/` |
| Purpose | Configure org settings (no API equivalent) | Validate business workflows |
| When they run | Mid-flow in `prepare_rlm_org` | On demand after provisioning |
| Idempotent? | Yes — detects state before toggling | Yes — resets account first |
| Headed? | Headless by default | Headless default, headed for debug |
| Asserts logic? | No — only asserts control was set | Yes — verifies records/assets |

### Setup tests — what they configure

| Robot File | What | Why Robot? |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| `configure_revenue_settings` | Pricing Procedure, Usage Rating, Instant Pricing, flows | Shadow DOM controls, no API |
| `configure_core_pricing_setup` | Default Pricing Procedure on CorePricingSetup page | Shadow DOM combobox, no API |
| `configure_product_discovery_settings` | Default Catalog on Product Discovery Settings page | Shadow DOM combobox, no API |
| `enable_analytics` | CRM Analytics + Data Sync toggle | Light DOM button on `InsightsSetupGettingStarted/home` (VF iframe removed in 262+), no API |
| `enable_document_builder` | Document Builder toggle | Shadow DOM, no API |
| `enable_constraints_settings` | Transaction Type, Asset Context, Constraints Engine | Shadow DOM, no API |
| `reorder_app_launcher` | App Launcher ordering | SortOrder is platform read-only |

### E2E tests — what they validate

| Robot File | Flow | Prerequisite |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `quote_to_order` | Full Reset→Opp→Quote→Products→Order→Assets | `prepare_rlm_org` with `qb=true` |
| `setup_quote` | Part 1: Reset→Opp→Quote | Same |
| `order_from_quote` | Part 2: Products→Order→Assets | A Quote must exist |
| `reset_account` | Reset Account via QuickAction | An account must exist |

## CCI Task Wiring

For detailed CCI task tables, Python wrapper patterns, shadow DOM
traversal code, LWC reactivity patterns, keyword references, and
test authoring guides, read `.cursor/skills/robot-testing/patterns.md`.

For **agent-oriented** setup-UI pitfalls (shadow vs iframe, logging, when
not to copy generic Selenium), read
`.cursor/skills/robot-testing/setup-ui-shadow-dom.md`.

### Running tests

```bash
cci task run robot_e2e --org beta              # headless
cci task run robot_e2e_debug --org beta         # headed + CDP port 9222
cci task run robot_e2e_debug -o pause_for_recording true --org beta  # with pauses
```
