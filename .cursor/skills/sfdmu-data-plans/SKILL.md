# SFDMU v5 Data Plans

SFDMU v5.6.4+ is required (5.6.4 fixed Upsert matching for relationship-traversal externalIds). v4 syntax is not supported.

## Quick Rules

1. externalId delimiter is `;` — NOT `$$` (that's v4).
2. Relationship-traversal externalId matches under `Upsert` on the 5.6.4+ floor (Bugs 2/3/5 fixed) — the old `Insert` + `deleteOldData: true` workaround is pre-5.6.4. Only Bug 4 (`$$` in lookup reference columns — self-referential *and* cross-object) is still live.
3. Never change Upsert → Insert+deleteOldData without explicit user approval.
4. Empty CSV → set `excluded: true` (prevents destructive wipe).
5. Parent → child order in `objects` array (deletion runs reverse).
6. `$$` CSV column must match externalId fields exactly.
7. After extraction: run `post_process_extraction.py` to add `$$` columns.
8. **A plan that loads cleanly into a fresh org is not safe to re-run into a *used* org** — check the plan's operations against what the org already has. See *Reloading a plan into a live org*.

## DO NOT

- **DO NOT** use `$$Field1$Field2` syntax in `externalId` (v4, not v5)
- **DO NOT** change `Upsert` to `Insert+deleteOldData` without user approval
- **DO NOT** leave empty CSVs without `excluded: true`
- **DO NOT** use `$$` composite notation for lookup reference columns in CSVs (Bug 4 — self-referential and cross-object `$$` references fail on import; use simple field references)
- **DO NOT** add `Insert` + `deleteOldData: true` for a relationship-traversal externalId citing Bugs 2/3/5 — those are fixed on the 5.6.4+ floor; `Upsert` matches. (Existing plans that still carry that pattern migrate under the gated `sfdmu-v5-optimization` initiative, not ad hoc.)
- **DO NOT** re-run a plan into an org with live transactional data to add one record — see below

## export.json Structure

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "67.0",
  "excludeIdsFromCSVFiles": "true",
  "objectSets": [
    {
      "objects": [
        {
          "query": "SELECT Field1, Field2, LookupId FROM SObject ORDER BY Field1 ASC",
          "operation": "Upsert",
          "externalId": "Field1;Field2",
          "excluded": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "orgs": []
}
```

## externalId Rules (v5)

- Use `;` delimiters: `Field1;Field2` (NOT `$$Field1$Field2` — that is v4 syntax)
- `$$` composite key columns in CSVs are still valid for source-record matching
- Relationship traversals in externalId: `Parent.Field` (1-hop), `GrandParent.Parent.Field` (2-hop)

## Operation Selection Guide

| Situation | Operation | deleteOldData | Why |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Has a direct unique field (Name, Code, etc.) | `Upsert` | `false` | Safe matching on direct fields |
| Composite uniqueness, all direct fields | `Upsert` | `false` | `$$` column in CSV enables matching |
| externalId uses any relationship traversal | `Upsert` | `false` | 5.6.4+ matches on traversals (Bugs 3/5 fixed); `Insert`+`deleteOldData` was the pre-5.6.4 workaround |
| Auto-number Name + all-relationship externalId | `Upsert` | `false` | 5.6.4+ matches on the traversal externalId (Bugs 3/5 fixed) — the auto-number Name is not the match key |
| Read-only reference (already loaded by another plan) | `Readonly` | `false` | Just resolves IDs for child lookups |
| Updating existing records (set fields) | `Update` | `false` | Only modifies matched records |
| Empty CSV (no records yet) | mark `excluded: true` | — | Prevents destructive delete-on-load |

## Bug 4 — `$$` Composite Notation Fails for Lookup Reference Columns (self-referential and cross-object)

**Problem:** When an object has a self-referential lookup (e.g., `ProductComponentGroup.ParentGroupId` → `ProductComponentGroup`) and the CSV uses `$$` composite key notation for that reference (e.g., `ParentGroup.$$Code$ParentProduct.StockKeepingUnit`), SFDMU cannot resolve the parent record. The MissingParentRecordsReport shows anonymized hashes instead of matched records, and the lookup fields are left null after import — even though the parent records exist and SFDMU runs multiple passes.

**Root cause:** SFDMU's `$$` composite notation works for the *primary* record's externalId matching (source↔target), but fails when used as a *lookup reference column* — for **self-referential and cross-object** relationships alike. SFDMU cannot decompose a composite `$$` value back into individual fields to find the referenced record.

**Fix:** Use simple single-field references for self-referential lookups:
- Change `ParentGroup.$$Code$ParentProduct.StockKeepingUnit` → `ParentGroup.Code`
- Ensure the `externalId` for the object is the simple field (e.g., `Code`) — not a composite
- This works when the simple field is unique (or unique within the context of the plan)

**Example (ProductComponentGroup):**
```
# BROKEN — ParentGroup reference uses $$ composite, SFDMU cannot resolve
Header: $$Code$ParentProduct.StockKeepingUnit,...,ParentGroup.$$Code$ParentProduct.StockKeepingUnit
Value:  Cooling;QB-QRack-750,...,Computing;QB-QRack-750
externalId: "Code;ParentProduct.StockKeepingUnit"

# WORKS — ParentGroup reference uses simple field
Header: Code,...,ParentGroup.Code
Value:  Cooling,...,Computing
externalId: "Code"
```

**Audit required:** Review all data plans that use `$$` composite columns as *lookup references* (not just primary keys). Cross-object `$$` references (e.g., `ProductComponentGroup.$$Code$...` referenced from `ProductRelatedComponent`) fail the same way as self-references — SFDMU cannot decompose a composite `$$` value in **any** lookup-reference column. **Fix (both cases):** use a simple single-field reference for the lookup column.

## v5 Bugs — one live on the 5.6.4 floor, four fixed upstream

With **v5.6.4+ as the required floor**, the historical Upsert-matching bugs are
fixed and **only Bug 4 is still live**. On a 5.6.4+ plugin, author traversal
externalId plans as `Upsert` — do not add `Insert` + `deleteOldData: true`
citing Bugs 1/2/3/5. (See the dedicated **Bug 4** section above for the one live
case; existing plans still carrying Insert+deleteOldData migrate under the gated
`sfdmu-v5-optimization` initiative.)

<details>
<summary>Bugs 1/2/3/5 — fixed at or below the 5.6.4 floor (history; do NOT apply their workarounds on 5.6.4+)</summary>

- **Bug 1 — all-multi-hop externalId fails validation** (`{Object} has no mandatory external Id field definition`). **Fixed in 5.3.1.** *Was:* include at least one direct field in externalId.
- **Bug 2 — 2-hop traversal columns produce malformed SOQL in the Upsert TARGET SELECT.** **Fixed in 5.6.3.** *Was:* `Insert` + `deleteOldData: true`. *Residue by design:* dotted composite segments are still dropped from child `__r` queries on **extract** (the `#N/A` blanking that `post_process_extraction.py` backfills; 5.6.3 also set `#N/A` = null marker, bare `N/A` = literal).
- **Bug 3 — Upsert with relationship-traversal externalId never matches** (duplicates every run, even 1-hop). **Fixed in the 5.6.4 release** (commit `50be987`, `_getNestedRecordFieldValue`; source-verified). *Was:* `Insert` + `deleteOldData: true`.
- **Bug 5 — composite externalId of all relationship traversals fails upsert matching.** **Fixed in 5.6.4** (same relationship-path matching fix). *Was:* prefer a direct-field externalId, else `Insert` + `deleteOldData: true` after approval.

</details>

## CRITICAL — Insert + deleteOldData Safety

**Never change Upsert to Insert + deleteOldData without:**
1. Explaining which *current* reason makes Upsert impossible (on the 5.6.4+ floor Bugs 1/2/3/5 are fixed — not those historical bugs)
2. Confirming no direct-field externalId alternative exists
3. Getting explicit user approval

`deleteOldData: true` deletes ALL existing records before inserting. Misapplied, it wipes data that Upsert would have safely matched.

## Reloading a Plan Into a Live Org

Plans are written for a **fresh org**. Re-running one into an org that already has
assets, entitlements, or other transactional data can duplicate or fail — and the
failure mode differs by operation. Check before re-running:

| Operation | Re-run into a used org |
|-----------|------------------------|
| `Upsert` / `Update` | ✅ No duplicates — matches on externalId (qb-pcm, qb-billing, qb-tax). ⚠️ Not the same as "the change applies": objects carrying `skipExistingRecords: true` (all the qb-billing billing objects) skip matched rows entirely, so a **correction** to existing data silently does not land. |
| `Insert`, **no** `deleteOldData` | ⛔ **Duplicates every row.** No matching happens at all. |
| `Insert` + `deleteOldData: true` | ⛔ Blocked when live records reference the design-time rows it must delete first |

Two concrete traps in the QB plans:

- **`qb-pricing` inserts `PricebookEntry` with no `deleteOldData`** — re-running the
  **task** (`insert_quantumbit_pricing_data`) on its own duplicates every entry. The
  **flow** is safe: `prepare_pricing_data` runs `delete_quantumbit_pricing_data`
  first, which clears every Insert-operation object in the plan. So reach for the
  flow, or run the delete task yourself before the insert.
- **`qb-rating` / `qb-rates` use `Insert` + `deleteOldData`** — which cannot clear
  design-time rows (PUR/PUG/RateCardEntry, and `AssetRateCardEntry` referencing
  `RateCardEntry`) while live entitlements point at them. The delete silently leaves
  them and you get a duplicate Draft set.

**To add one product to a live org, load it surgically** — insert just the new
records and their relationships (a throwaway script or anonymous Apex), rather than
re-running the plan. Then:

1. **Still commit the new rows to the plan CSVs** so a *fresh* build picks them up.
2. Update the plan README and re-run `check_plan_readme_consistency.py`.
3. **Verify plan-level wiring on the next full `prepare_rlm_org` build** — a
   surgical load proves the *records* work, not that the *plan* creates them
   correctly. Track that verification as owed work until it runs.

## Object Ordering

Objects in the `objects` array must be ordered **parent → child**. SFDMU deletes `deleteOldData: true` objects in **reverse array order** (last deleted first), so parent-first ordering ensures child records are deleted before parents.

## SOQL Query Rules

- ORDER BY fields must appear in the SELECT clause
- Relationship traversal columns in SOQL must match CSV header expectations
- Use relationship notation for lookup references: `Parent.Field` not `ParentId`

## CSV Conventions

- `$$` composite key columns: header format `$$Field1$Parent.Field2` — values must match exactly
- Empty CSVs: must have `excluded: true` in export.json to prevent destructive delete
- After extraction, run `scripts/post_process_extraction.py` to add `$$` columns (SFDMU v5 doesn't write them during extraction)

## Self-Lookup Edge Case (Generic)

For self-referential lookups (`Object.LookupToSameObject__c`), updates may be skipped when
the plan uses only traversal columns (`LookupToSameObject__r.Name`) in an `Update` pass.
SFDMU can reduce runtime source columns and treat rows as unchanged.

### Proven Working Pattern

For the update pass, include BOTH:
- the lookup ID field(s) (`LookupToSameObject__c`)
- the traversal reference field(s) (`LookupToSameObject__r.<ExternalIdField>`)

This combination helps SFDMU compute deltas and apply updates reliably for
self-referential lookups.

Example (Account self-lookups):
- `RLM_Primary_Distributor__c` + `RLM_Primary_Distributor__r.Name`
- `RLM_Primary_Reseller__c` + `RLM_Primary_Reseller__r.Name`

### Diagnostics

If lookup updates are unexpectedly skipped:
1. Check `source/*_source.csv` after a run. If expected lookup columns are missing there,
   SFDMU dropped them before processing.
2. Run with `simulation: true` to inspect pass-level behavior safely.
3. Compare SOURCE/TARGET query lines in task logs to confirm the effective field list.

## Multi-Pass Architecture

Some plans use multiple objectSets (passes) to handle circular dependencies or activation ordering:
- **Pass 1**: Insert records in Draft/Inactive status
- **Pass 2**: Update records to Active status (after dependencies exist)
- **Pass 3**: Set cross-references that require both ends to exist

Example: `qb-billing` uses 3 passes: draft insert → activate treatment items → activate treatments and set BillingPolicy.DefaultBillingTreatmentId.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] externalId uses `;` delimiters (not `$$`)
- [ ] Relationship-traversal externalId uses `operation: Upsert` (matches on the 5.6.4+ floor — do NOT add Insert+deleteOldData citing Bugs 2/3/5)
- [ ] ORDER BY fields present in SELECT clause
- [ ] Relationship traversal columns in SOQL match CSV headers
- [ ] Empty CSVs have `excluded: true`
- [ ] Objects ordered parent → child
- [ ] `$$` composite key CSV headers match externalId fields exactly
- [ ] `deleteOldData: true` only where a concrete *current* reason applies + user approval (Bugs 1/2/3/5 are fixed on 5.6.4+ — not justifications)
- [ ] No `$$` composite notation used for lookup reference columns (Bug 4 — use simple field references instead)
- [ ] Self-referential lookups use simple field references (e.g., `ParentGroup.Code` not `ParentGroup.$$Code$...`)
- [ ] All-traversal externalIds use `Upsert` on the 5.6.4+ floor (Bugs 3/5 fixed); any residual `Insert` + `deleteOldData: true` is a pre-5.6.4 plan awaiting the gated `sfdmu-v5-optimization` migration

## Developer-Local Scratch Directory

`datasets/sfdmu/test/` is a developer-local scratch area for experimental and throwaway plans. It is:

- **Gitignored** — `datasets/sfdmu/test/**` in `.gitignore`; never committed or pushed
- **Excluded from validation** — `validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py` skips `test/` and `*.bak` directories
- **Not referenced** by any shipped task, flow, CI job, or test

To clean up local scratch plans: `rm -rf datasets/sfdmu/test/`

**Convention:** Never commit anything under `datasets/sfdmu/test/`. Never add a shipped plan there. For real plans, use `datasets/sfdmu/qb/`, `mfg/`, `q3/`, `procedure-plans/`, or `scratch_data/`.

## Validation Tool

```bash
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py                           # validate all shipped plans (skips test/ and *.bak)
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --dataset datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pricing  # one plan
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --fix-all --dry-run       # preview fixes
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --fix-all                 # apply fixes
```

The validator checks the **plan** (export.json/CSV v5 compliance). To check that the
plan's **README** still matches the plan after you edit objects/CSVs (record counts,
operations, externalIds, phantom/missing objects), run the consistency checker — it
fails (exit 1) on drift, so it doubles as a pre-merge gate:

```bash
python scripts/ai/check_plan_readme_consistency.py                                  # all plans
python scripts/ai/check_plan_readme_consistency.py datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pricing  # one plan
```
