# Troubleshooting & Common Errors

Use this skill when diagnosing failures in the rlm-base-dev build pipeline,
data loading, metadata deployment, or local environment setup.

## Quick Rules

1. Run `cci task run validate_setup` first — it checks everything.
2. CCI alias `beta` ≠ SF CLI alias `rlm-base__beta`. Never mix them.
3. SFDMU load fails → check stdout for specific object error.
4. Duplicates on re-run → missing `$$` composite key column in CSV.
5. Rating errors → always delete rates before rating (FK constraint).
6. Deploy fails → check for missing fields or wrong deploy order.
7. Source tracking corrupt → `rm -rf .sf/orgs/<org-id>/localSourceTracking`
8. Active billing records → can NEVER be deleted (platform constraint).
9. Rated usage reads **zero** with no error → an ordering problem, not a data problem. See [Usage & Consumption Errors](#usage--consumption-errors).
10. Usage records won't delete in any order → the graph is **circular**; use a convergent loop.

## Environment & Setup Errors

### `cci task run validate_setup` fails

Run this first — it checks everything:

| Check | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Python < 3.10 | Install Python 3.12 or 3.13 via `pyenv` (3.10 is the repo floor; 3.12/3.13 are recommended for CumulusCI) |
| CumulusCI not found | `pipx install cumulusci --python "$(pyenv prefix)/bin/python3"` |
| SF CLI < v2 | `npm install -g @salesforce/cli` (NOT `brew install sf`) |
| SFDMU plugin missing/outdated | Auto-fixed by default (`auto_fix=true`). Manual: `sf plugins install sfdmu` |
| Node.js not found | `nvm install --lts && nvm alias default lts/*` |
| Robot Framework deps missing | Auto-fixed by default. Manual: `pipx inject cumulusci --force -r robot/requirements.txt` |
| Chrome/ChromeDriver missing | Install Chrome; `pip install webdriver-manager` |
| urllib3 < 2.6.3 (CVE) | `pipx inject cumulusci urllib3>=2.6.3` |

### `sf` or `node` not found in IDE / CI

**Cause:** `~/.zshenv` is missing nvm/pyenv init blocks. Non-interactive
shells (IDE terminals, CI runners) don't source `~/.zshrc`.

**Fix:** Add both nvm and pyenv init to `~/.zshenv` AND `~/.zshrc`.

### "Org not found" or "auth failed" errors

CCI and `sf` CLI maintain **separate org registries** with different aliases.

| Tool | Alias Format | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `cci` (`--org`) | Short alias | `beta` |
| `sf` (`--target-org`) | Project-prefixed | `rlm-base__beta` |
| Either | Username (always works) | `test-abc123@example.com` |

**Common mistakes:**
- Using CCI alias `beta` with `sf` CLI → **fails** (use `rlm-base__beta`)
- Using SF CLI alias `rlm-base__beta` with `cci` → **fails** (use `beta`)
- Using `org_config.access_token` as `--target-org` → **fails** + leaks secret

**In Python tasks:** Always use `self.org_config.username` for `sf` CLI
calls. Use `self.org_config.access_token` + `.instance_url` only for
direct REST API calls via `requests`.

```bash
# Find the right identifier
cci org list              # shows CCI aliases
sf org list               # shows sf aliases (rlm-base__* prefix)
cci org info beta         # shows username, instance URL
```

### `INVALID_AUTH_HEADER` / "Expired session" on a healthy scratch org

**Symptom:** every `cci` command that touches an org fails with
`INVALID_AUTH_HEADER` (or "Expired session"), even on a brand-new org — but
`sf data query --target-org USERNAME` reaches the same org fine.

**Cause:** CumulusCI 4.10 parses `sf org display` for the access token, and
sf CLI >= 2.13.0 now **redacts** it. CCI sends a bogus header.

**Fix:** set `SF_TEMP_SHOW_SECRETS=true`. The repo's tracked `.envrc` already exports
it, so **direnv users are covered automatically** inside the repo; otherwise prefix a
command for a one-off, or for a durable / Dock-launched-IDE setup use `~/.zshenv` + a
LaunchAgent. **Do not** delete or recreate the org — and never `cci org remove` a
scratch org (it deletes it).
Full guide, including the durable setup, the security tradeoff, and **how to
check for / remove the workaround once an official fix ships**:
[cci-sf-cli-token-workaround.md](../../../docs/guides/cci-sf-cli-token-workaround.md).

### `NonScratchOrgError` ("This command works with only scratch orgs")

**Symptom:** a scratch-only SF CLI command — most often `sf org create user`
(the `create_personas_sales_rep_user` task in `prepare_personas`), but also
`sf org generate password` — fails with `NonScratchOrgError` against an org you
created as a scratch org. Common on **Enterprise-Edition / "ent"** shapes
(e.g. `orgs/internal/ent-r1.json`).

**Cause:** an SF CLI bug — EE scratch orgs created via the DevHub API get
`"isScratch": false` written to the local auth file
(`~/.sfdx/<username>.json`) even though they are real scratch orgs (valid
`devHubUsername`, listed under `scratchOrgs` in `sf org list`). The CLI then
refuses scratch-only commands. CCI's own `org_config.scratch` is unaffected, so
**`prepare_rlm_org` self-heals** — `prepare_core` step 1 runs
`fix_scratch_org_identity` before any scratch-only CLI command.

**Fix (standalone, when running CLI commands outside the flow):**

```bash
cci org default ent-r1                      # this CCI build uses the default org (no --org)
cci task run fix_scratch_org_identity        # sets isScratch=true (when false or missing) if devHubUsername is present
```

The task is idempotent (no-op when already correct) and only sets
`isScratch=true` (when it is false or missing) when the auth file has a
`devHubUsername` (so it never mis-tags a real non-scratch org).

---

## SFDMU Data Loading Errors

### Load fails with non-zero exit code

Check the SFDMU stdout for the specific object and error. Common causes:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `has no mandatory external Id field definition` | All-multi-hop externalId (v5 Bug 1) | **Fixed at the 5.6.4+ floor** — should not occur; if it does, verify the plugin is ≥5.6.4 (`validate_setup`) |
| Invalid SOQL generated | 2-hop traversal column in Upsert (v5 Bug 2) | **Fixed in 5.6.3** — should not occur on the 5.6.4+ floor; verify the plugin version |
| Duplicates on every run | Relationship-traversal externalId in Upsert (v5 Bug 3) | **Fixed in 5.6.4** — Upsert matches on the floor; verify the plugin version. (Do NOT switch to `Insert`+`deleteOldData` citing this bug.) |
| `REQUIRED_FIELD_MISSING` | Parent records not loaded yet | Check plan dependency order (PCM before pricing/billing) |
| `DUPLICATE_VALUE` | Composite key mismatch | Verify `$$` column in CSV matches `externalId` fields |

### Idempotency test fails (record count increased)

**Cause:** Missing or mismatched `$$` composite key column in the CSV. The
second load inserts instead of matching.

**Fix:** Verify that `$$` column header in CSV matches the `externalId`
fields exactly (e.g., `externalId: "Field1;Field2"` → CSV header
`$$Field1$Field2`). Run `python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py` to
check all plans.

### Dynamic `AssignedTo` user lookup fails

**Cause:** `dynamic_assigned_to_user: true` queries the org for a user, but
the org auth is token-only (no username).

**Fix:** Use `cci org connect` instead of JWT-only auth, or set the username
in the org config.

---

## Metadata Deploy Errors

### Deploy fails with component errors

Check the deploy result for specific component names. Common causes:

| Component Type | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------------|-------------|-----|
| FlexiPage | References object/field not yet deployed | Ensure the referenced metadata is in `force-app/` or deployed in an earlier step |
| Layout | References field that doesn't exist | Add the field to the pre-deploy bundle |
| Profile | Contains `layoutAssignment` in `force-app/` | **Never** add layout assignments to `force-app/` profiles — use `templates/profiles/` |
| ExpressionSet | `__ATTRIBUTEPasID__` not replaced | XPath transform query failed — check `PriceAdjustmentSchedule` records exist |

### Deploy timeout (600s for UX, 300s for stamp)

**Cause:** Slow org response or large deploy payload.

**Fix:** Retry. If persistent, check org health and reduce deploy size by
using `metadata_type` or `metadata_name` options on `assemble_and_deploy_ux`.

### Source tracking corruption

**Symptom:** Deploy succeeds but `sf project deploy` complains about
conflicts on subsequent runs.

**Fix:**
```bash
rm -rf .sf/orgs/<org-id>/localSourceTracking
```

---

## Permission & PSG Errors

### Permission Set Group stuck in "Outdated"

**Cause:** PSG needs recalculation after PSL changes or deploy.

**Fix:** The `recalculate_permission_set_groups` task handles this
automatically — it touches the PSG Description field to trigger recalc,
then polls. If it times out:
1. Check PSG status in Setup → Permission Set Groups
2. Manually trigger recalculation
3. Increase `timeout_seconds` option (default 300s)

### PSG recalculation fails with "Failed" status

**Cause:** Conflicting permissions in the PSG's member permission sets.

**Fix:** Check Setup → Permission Set Groups → the failing PSG for conflict
details. Remove conflicting permission set members.

---

## Context Definition Errors

### `INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS` on context plan apply

**Cause:** Connect API PATCH rejects relationship-traversal hydration rules.

**Fix:** This is handled automatically by the task — it falls back to
direct SObject REST API calls for `ContextAttributeMapping` and
`ContextAttrHydrationDetail` records. If it still fails, verify the running
user has the correct PSLs assigned.

### Context definition not found

**Cause:** `developer_name` doesn't match any existing context definition.

**Fix:** Context definitions are extended at runtime by `extend_context_*`
tasks in `prepare_core` (step 1). Ensure `prepare_core` ran successfully
before the failing step.

---

## Decision Table Errors

### Pricing is right in the data and wrong at runtime

**Cause:** A decision table is a materialised cache with no invalidation. A
refresh copies source rows in; nothing re-reads the source afterwards. So a
correct catalog, rate or contracted price that never reached a table reads as a
pricing bug — a tier that does not apply, a new SKU priced as if it did not
exist.

**Fix:** Check freshness before debugging anything else. A Stale verdict naming
the object you just edited is the answer.
```bash
cci task run check_decision_table_freshness --org beta
```
Runs `scripts/apex/checkDecisionTableFreshness.apex` and reports every table with
a verdict and a reason. Read-only. Add `-o param1 strict` to fail a build on any
stale table — only where no data load follows the refresh.

⚠ **"Not comparable" is not a failure.** It means the check declined to guess.
Only **Stale** is a positive finding. Verdicts are scoped to the running user's
visible rows, so run it as an operator with org-wide read.

Full detail — what each verdict means, the timing rule for automatic refreshes,
and why a lookup goes stale without its own row changing:
[Decision Tables](../decision-tables/SKILL.md).

### Refresh timeout

**Cause:** Decision table refresh can be slow, especially for large tables
with many entries.

**Fix:** Retry. If persistent, try refreshing tables individually:
```bash
cci task run manage_decision_tables -o operation refresh -o developer_names "Table_Name" --org beta
```

### Active decision tables block deploy

**Cause:** Metadata API can't overwrite active decision tables.

**Fix:** The flow handles this via `exclude_active_decision_tables` before
deploy and `restore_decision_tables` after. If the exclusion step fails,
manually deactivate the blocking tables:
```bash
cci task run manage_decision_tables -o operation deactivate -o developer_names "Table_Name" --org beta
```

---

## Expression Set Errors

### Row lock during activation/deactivation

**Symptom:** `UNABLE_TO_LOCK_ROW` error.

**Cause:** Concurrent access to expression set version records.

**Fix:** Automatic — the task retries 3 times with linear backoff (2s, 4s,
6s). If it still fails, wait and retry manually.

### Expression set activated without Rank

**Symptom:** Expression set version can't be deactivated or edited.

**Fix:** The `updateExpressionSetVersions.apex` script sets Rank before
activating. If you hit this manually, use Tooling API to update the version's
Rank field first.

---

## Rating & Rates Errors

### PUR activation fails: "effective period overlaps"

**Cause:** Duplicate Draft PURs exist (from re-running the plan without
deleting first).

**Fix:**
1. Delete rates data first: `cci task run delete_qb_rates_data --org beta`
2. Delete rating data: `cci task run delete_qb_rating_data --org beta`
3. Re-load: `cci task run insert_qb_rating_data --org beta`

**Critical:** Always delete rates before rating (FK constraint).

### PUR deactivation ordering

**Cause:** Platform requires PURs to be deactivated in a specific order —
can't deactivate a PUR when related PURs on the same Product are still Active.

**Fix:** The `deleteQbRatingData.apex` script handles this with iterative
`Database.update(records, false)` (partial success) in a loop until all
are deactivated. If it hangs, check for PURs with unexpected relationships.

### Rate card entry deletion blocked

**Cause:** Can't delete rate adjustment records when related rate card entries
are inactive.

**Fix:** `deleteQbRatesData.apex` deletes in correct dependency order:
RateAdjustmentByTier → RateCardEntry → PriceBookRateCard → RateCard.

---

## Usage & Consumption Errors

Procedure and rules: `.cursor/skills/usage-consumption/SKILL.md`. Object reference:
`.cursor/skills/revenue-cloud-data-model/domains/usage.md`. Worked arithmetic:
`docs/guides/qb-consumption-demo-scenarios.md`.

### Rated usage reads ZERO and nothing reported an error

The most common usage failure — and it is **silent**. Three causes, all ordering:

1. **Usage was recorded after the period was orchestrated.** A `UsageSummary` at
   `RatableSummaryComplete` / `LiableSummaryComplete` **never reopens**; journals
   arriving later stay `Pending` forever.
2. **The first orchestration pass on an account closes every past period EMPTY.**
3. **Usage was booked into the CURRENT period.** It stays `InProgress` with buckets
   untouched — which looks like "full discount, no drawdown".

**Fix:** record usage into a **PAST** period *before* orchestrating it, then run
orchestration **several times** (one pass does not settle it).

```bash
python scripts/qb_usage.py audit          # what config/entitlements exist
python scripts/qb_usage.py orchestrate    # drive a pass
python scripts/qb_usage.py report         # what actually rated
```

### Journals stay `Pending` on a commitment asset

**Cause:** usage was uploaded against the **commitment** asset. A commitment is a
rate modifier, not a consumption target.

**Fix:** record against the **anchor** asset. If the commitment is being ignored
entirely, check that a `UsageCmtAssetRelatedObj` row links them (`AssetId` =
commitment, `RelatedObjectId` = anchor) — without it the commitment is inert.

### `INVALID_INPUT: "This field must be empty when the product ... commitment usage model types"`

**Cause:** a `ProductUsageResourcePolicy` on a **Commit / CommitmentQuantity /
CommitmentSpend** product carries `RatingFrequencyPolicyId` or
`UsageAggregationPolicyId`.

**Fix:** commitment PURPs may carry **only** `UsageCommitmentPolicyId`. This is
platform-enforced, not a preference.

### A delete of usage records fails no matter what order you try

**Cause:** the usage graph has **circular** delete constraints — there is no valid
fixed order.

**Fix:** use a **convergent loop** (attempt every object each round, stop when a
round makes no progress) — `scripts/apex/clearUsageData.apex` org-wide, or
`RLM_AccountUtilities` per account.

⚠ **A savepoint hides your progress.** If the teardown runs inside a savepoint and
rolls back on failure, every successful delete is undone and only the
first-surfacing blocker is ever visible — you will "fix" it five times and see a
different error each run.

### A SOQL semi-join silently matches nothing

**Cause:** the filtered field is **polymorphic** (e.g. `BindingObjectId`, which can
point at Account / Asset / Contract / BindingObjectCustomExt). A semi-join against a
polymorphic lookup does not resolve — it matches nothing **and reports success**.

**Fix:** materialise the ids into a `Set<Id>` and bind that:

```apex
// BROKEN — silently matches nothing
[SELECT Id FROM X WHERE BindingObjectId IN (SELECT Id FROM Asset WHERE ...)]
// WORKS
Set<Id> assetIds = new Map<Id, Asset>([SELECT Id FROM Asset WHERE ...]).keySet();
[SELECT Id FROM X WHERE BindingObjectId IN :assetIds]
```

### Async rating/entitlement batch failed — find out why

Batch failures do not surface in the flow result. Query the forensic objects:

```bash
# Per-record failures inside a batch job part. NOTE the field names:
# ErrorDescription (not ErrorMessage) and Record (not RecordId).
sf data query -q "SELECT Id, ErrorDescription, Record, RecordName, Status FROM BatchJobPartFailedRecord ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 20" --target-org <alias>

# Entitlements that never finished processing.
# TransactionUsageEntitlement has NO Status field — EntitlementProcessingStatus
# is the only status, and its values are PENDING / PROCESSED.
sf data query -q "SELECT Id, Name, UsageModelType, EntitlementProcessingStatus FROM TransactionUsageEntitlement WHERE EntitlementProcessingStatus = 'PENDING'" --target-org <alias>
```

⚠ Entitlements for `CommitmentQuantity` / `CommitmentSpend` products are **known to
stay `PENDING`** in 262 — a platform issue, not a data defect. `Commit` works.

---

## Billing & Tax Errors

### Active billing records can't be deleted

**Cause:** Platform constraint — Active `BillingTreatment` and
`BillingTreatmentItem` records can never be deleted.

**Fix:** `deleteDraftBillingRecords.apex` only deletes Draft records. Active
billing records must be deactivated before deletion (if the platform allows),
or the org must be recreated.

### BillingTreatment missing BillingPolicyId

**Cause:** Data load ordering issue — BillingTreatment loaded before its
parent BillingPolicy.

**Fix:** Validate structure first:
```bash
cci task run validate_billing_structure --org beta
```
Then reload: delete billing data and re-run `insert_billing_data`.

---

## DocGen Errors

### DocumentTemplate binary mismatch

**Symptom:** All DocumentTemplates have the same binary content after deploy.

**Cause:** Salesforce Metadata API bug — all DocumentTemplates deployed in a
single batch receive the same ContentDocument binary (first alphabetically).

**Fix:** The `fix_document_template_binaries` task corrects this by uploading
the correct `.dt` binary for each template. Ensure it runs after
`deploy_post_docgen` + `activate_docgen_templates`.

### EmailTemplatePage deploy fails

**Cause:** `EmailTemplatePage` flexipages cannot be deployed via Metadata API
(permanent platform restriction).

**Fix:** These are in `.forceignore`. The templates are created at runtime by
`create_approval_email_templates` via the REST API. Do NOT add
`EmailTemplatePage` files to `templates/flexipages/`.

---

## UX Assembly Errors

### AppSwitcher deploy blocked

**Symptom:** AppSwitcher excluded from deploy; warning logged.

**Cause:** Org's AppMenu contains managed ConnectedApp or Network entries that
the Metadata API can't validate.

**Fix:** This is by design. The `reorder_app_launcher` task (step 2 of
`prepare_ux`) handles App Launcher ordering via Aura XHR. No action needed.

### Assembled UX has wrong content

**Cause:** Editing `unpackaged/post_ux/` directly instead of `templates/`.

**Fix:** Edit the source templates, then re-assemble:
```bash
cci task run assemble_and_deploy_ux -o deploy false
```
Inspect `unpackaged/post_ux/` to verify, then deploy.

---

## PRM & Community Errors

### Network deploy fails (emailSenderAddress)

**Cause:** The committed `rlm.network-meta.xml` uses a placeholder email.
The `patch_network_email_for_deploy` task replaces it with the org's actual
email before deploy.

**Fix:** If the patch task fails, the Network's email is immutable after
creation. Verify the Network exists with:
```bash
sf data query -q "SELECT Id, Name, UrlPathPrefix FROM Network" --target-org rlm-base__beta
```

### Placeholder email committed to repo

**Cause:** `revert_network_email_after_deploy` didn't run after deploy.

**Fix:** Run it manually:
```bash
cci task run revert_network_email_after_deploy --org beta
```
Or reset the file: `git checkout -- unpackaged/post_prm/force-app/main/default/networks/rlm.network-meta.xml`

---

## Constraints / CML Errors

### Unresolved ESC associations

**Cause:** Product catalog (qb-pcm) not loaded before constraint model
import.

**Fix:**
1. Load PCM data: `cci task run insert_quantumbit_pcm_data --org beta`
2. Retry import: `cci task run import_cml -o data_dir <path> --org beta`

---

## DRO Errors

### ProductFulfillmentDecompRule missing ExecuteOnRuleId

**Cause:** Salesforce 260 platform bug — `ExecuteOnRuleId` not created on
INSERT.

**Fix:** The `update_product_fulfillment_decomp_rules` task re-saves the
records to trigger ruleset generation. If it still fails, manually re-save
in Setup.

---

## Live-Org Evidence Capture (RLM async / pricing / preprocess failures)

RLM async failures (Place Sales Transaction, preprocess, assetize, rating) leave their
root cause in **records, not stdout** — and that evidence is **destroyed by an account/
data reset**. So when a UI flow fails (e.g. "Preprocessing failed", "prices aren't
updated", an activation/repricing error):

1. **Capture before any reset.** Note the record id from the URL/UI, then query the
   error logs + async trackers + the record's calc state immediately:

```bash
# The actual failure reason (message + code + category)
sf data query --target-org $ORG -q "SELECT Category, ErrorCode, Severity, ErrorMessage, ConfiguratorErrorMessage, PrimaryRecordId, CreatedDate FROM RevenueTransactionErrorLog ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 15"
# Async job outcomes (PSTBaseJob/PSTPrice/PSTPersist/PreprocessOrder/AssetizationAsyncJob/QuoteToOrderJob)
sf data query --target-org $ORG -q "SELECT JobType, Status, ReferenceEntityId, CreatedDate FROM AsyncOperationTracker ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 25"
# The record's pricing/preprocess state (Order example)
sf data query --target-org $ORG -q "SELECT Status, CalculationStatus, ValidationResult, PreprocessingStatus FROM Order WHERE Id='<id>'"
```

2. **Interpret the signals.** `RevenueTransactionErrorLog.ErrorMessage` is usually the
   real reason; `CalculationStatus` is the pricing lifecycle; `ValidationResult != null`
   means "prices not current"; `AsyncOperationTracker.Status=Failure` pinpoints the failed
   async job. Settings/config live in metadata, not SOQL — retrieve them (see below), do
   not expect them in a query.

3. **Settings caution.** `sf project retrieve start -m Settings:RevenueManagement`
   decomposes org settings back into **existing** source paths (it can clobber
   `unpackaged/pre/1_settings/…` and other tracked copies). Retrieve to a throwaway, or
   `git checkout` the clobbered files afterward. Settings deploys **merge** field-by-field.

For the large-deal "Prepare for Activation" (reprice → preprocess → activate) flow
specifically — the `CalculationStatus` enum, the `ValidationResult` gate, async pricing
behavior, the `PreprocessingStatus` decode, and tax-skip — read
**`troubleshooting/large-deal-preprocess-reference.md`**.
