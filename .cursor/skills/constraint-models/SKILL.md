# Constraint Models (CML)

Working with Revenue Cloud Constraint Modeling Language models — the rules that decide
what a configurator will let a user select inside a bundle.

Covers the file layout, the four records a bundle member needs, how a change reaches an
org, and why a change can appear to deploy and still not take effect.

**Related:** `datasets/constraints/README.md` (the `export_cml` / `import_cml` /
`validate_cml` utility reference) · `.cursor/skills/expression-sets/SKILL.md` (Expression
Sets generally — constraint models are Expression Sets with `UsageType=Constraint`).

---

## Quick Rules

1. **The `.ffxblob` is plain text and it IS the artifact.** `import_cml` uploads it
   verbatim. Edit the blob.
2. **`scripts/cml/*.cml` is reference only.** Editing it changes nothing in any org. Where
   a model ships one, keep it byte-identical to the blob (`cp` from the blob) — not every
   model does.
3. **Importing into an ACTIVE version does not redeploy the model.** The version must be
   cycled — deactivate then reactivate — after the upload. `prepare_constraints` does this
   for the models it names. **A standalone `import_cml` does not**, so cycle it yourself.
   See [Making a change reach an org](#making-a-change-reach-an-org).
4. **Only the configurator proves deployment.** Reading `ConstraintModel` back proves the
   blob was *stored* — it is the same field `import_cml` writes. It cannot tell you the
   runtime rebuilt.
5. **A bundle member needs FOUR records, not one.** PRC row, `type` + `relation` in the
   model, an ESC `Type` association, and an ESC `Port` association.
6. **`Sequence` is part of the PRC composite key.** A Port association whose sequence
   disagrees with the PRC row **in the target org** fails to resolve — the SFDMU plan
   matters only because it is what loads that row. `import_cml` warns per row and raises —
   but **it half-applies first**: rows that did resolve are already created and the old
   ESC rows are not deleted. The blob is not uploaded, and a clean rerun clears the mix,
   so fix the cause and run it again.
7. **Exactly one model per family may be active** — for QuantumBit that means
   `QuantumBitBundle` *or* `Complete` *or* `PCM`, currently Bundle. Unrelated models
   (`Server2`, and the mfg models when they land) are active alongside it, so **discover
   what is active before deactivating anything** rather than reading a name out of a
   document. See [Discovering what you are working with](#discovering-what-you-are-working-with).

---

## DO NOT

- **DO NOT** edit `scripts/cml/*.cml` and expect an org to change. It is documentation.
- **DO NOT** treat `.ffxblob` as binary. It is ASCII CML source (`file` reports it as
  "c program text").
- **DO NOT** report a model change as verified because `import_cml` succeeded, **or**
  because `ConstraintModel` reads back with your change in it. `import_cml` writes that
  exact field, so reading it back only proves the upload was stored. Deployment is proved
  by selecting the product in the configurator.
- **DO NOT** add a **bundle member** without both its ESC `Type` **and** `Port`
  associations. A product with a PRC row but no `Type` association appears in the bundle
  and then fails Product Validation — the failure looks like a product problem, not a
  model problem. (`Port` is per bundle **relation**, not per type — a cart-level or
  virtual-quote type has no port. See below.)
- **DO NOT** invent a `Sequence` for a new PRC row. Copy the one the SFDMU plan already
  uses for that product — and if the Port still fails to resolve, check the **org**, which
  is what `import_cml` matches against.
- **DO NOT** activate a second QuantumBit model without deactivating the current one.
  `manage_expression_sets` toggles only the versions you name; it does not auto-deactivate
  others.

## Entry Conditions

Use this skill when you are:

- adding or removing a product from a configurable bundle's constraint model;
- editing CML types, relations, attributes or rules;
- debugging "product fails Product Validation when selected" in the configurator;
- debugging a model change that deployed but did not take effect;
- adding a whole new constraint model (see `datasets/constraints/README.md` →
  *Adding New Models*).

## <a name="discovering-what-you-are-working-with"></a>Discovering what you are working with

**Do not hardcode a model name from this or any other document.** The set of constraint
models differs per org and per feature flag, and grows as verticals are added. Three
sources, in the order you should consult them:

**1. What the org actually has** — authoritative for anything you are about to change:

```bash
# every constraint model and its active state
sf data query --target-org <sf_alias_or_username> -q "
  SELECT ExpressionSet.ApiName, ApiName, VersionNumber, IsActive
  FROM ExpressionSetVersion
  WHERE ExpressionSet.UsageType = 'Constraint'
  ORDER BY ExpressionSet.ApiName"
```

`ExpressionSet.UsageType = 'Constraint'` is the discriminator — that, not the name, is what
makes something a constraint model.

> **Two registries, two placeholders.** CCI and the `sf` CLI keep *separate* alias lists —
> a CCI alias `beta` is `rlm-base__beta` to `sf`. Recipes below use `<cci_alias>` with
> `cci … --org` and `<sf_alias_or_username>` with `sf … --target-org`; they are not
> interchangeable. See `AGENTS.md` → *Org Identity: CCI vs SF CLI*.

**2. What the repo ships** — authoritative for a fresh build, and the inventory a build
will import:

```bash
ls -d datasets/constraints/*/*/          # one directory per model, grouped by vertical
find datasets/constraints -name '*.ffxblob'
```

The **blob** set is the real inventory. A model can ship a blob with no matching
`scripts/cml/<Model>.cml` reference copy.

**3. What the flow imports and activates** — authoritative for what a build will end up
with, and the list to edit when adding a model:

```bash
cci flow info prepare_constraints    # import_cml steps, then the deactivate/activate lists
```

Adding a model means adding it to the data dir, the import steps, **and** the
activate/deactivate lists — see `datasets/constraints/README.md` → *Adding New Models*.

## The file layout

```
datasets/constraints/<vertical>/<Model>/     # e.g. qb/QuantumBitBundle, mfg/fuelCell
├── ExpressionSet.csv                        # the Expression Set (UsageType=Constraint)
├── ExpressionSetConstraintObj.csv           # ESC: Type + Port associations  <- the wiring
├── ExpressionSetDefinitionContextDefinition.csv
├── ExpressionSetDefinitionVersion.csv
├── Product2.csv                             # legacy Id -> Name map for remapping
├── ProductClassification.csv
├── ProductRelatedComponent.csv              # legacy Id -> composite key map
└── blobs/
    └── ESDV_<Model>_V1.ffxblob              # THE MODEL. Plain text CML.

scripts/cml/<Model>.cml                      # reference copy, byte-identical to the blob
                                             # (optional — QuantumBitPCM ships without one)
```

Ids in these CSVs are from the **authoring** org and are placeholders. `import_cml` remaps
them: `Product2` by **Name**, `ProductRelatedComponent` by **composite key**. So the
placeholder Id only has to be internally consistent, and mnemonic ones are conventional
(`01tWt000009CMTE` → Each, `...CMTF` → Flat, `...CMTB` → Bounded).

⚠️ `QuantumBitPCM` has a blob and **no** reference `.cml`, so the blob set — not the
`.cml` set — is the authoritative inventory of shipped models.

### What this repo ships today

Concrete instances, correct as of Release 262 — **verify with the queries above rather
than trusting this table**, which is a snapshot and will age:

| Model | Data dir | Reference `.cml` | Activated by `prepare_constraints`? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QuantumBitBundle` | `datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitBundle` | yes | **yes** — the active QB model |
| `QuantumBitComplete` | `datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitComplete` | yes | no — imported inactive, kept for A/B |
| `QuantumBitPCM` | `datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitPCM` | **no** | no — imported inactive, kept for A/B |
| `Server2` | `datasets/constraints/qb/Server2` | yes | **yes** — a separate model, not part of the QuantumBit family |

Two models are active at once, and that is correct: **`Server2` is not a QuantumBit
model.** The one-active-model rule is scoped to a family — exactly one of
`QuantumBitBundle` / `QuantumBitComplete` / `QuantumBitPCM` may be active — and says
nothing about unrelated models alongside it. Read "active" per family, not per org, before
deactivating anything.

(`Server2` lives under `datasets/constraints/qb/` for historical reasons; the directory it
sits in does not make it a QuantumBit model.)

Manufacturing adds `datasets/constraints/mfg/…` when that series lands, which is exactly
why the discovery queries matter more than this table.

## The four records a bundle member needs

Adding a product to a configurable bundle is not one change. Missing any of these fails
differently, and only the first is obvious:

| # | Record | Where | Symptom if missing |
|---|--------|-------|--------------------|
| 1 | `ProductRelatedComponent` | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm/ProductRelatedComponent.csv` | Product never appears in the bundle |
| 2 | `type` + `relation` | the `.ffxblob` | Model has no concept of the product |
| 3 | ESC association, `ConstraintModelTagType = Type` | `ExpressionSetConstraintObj.csv` | **Product appears, then fails Product Validation** |
| 4 | ESC association, `ConstraintModelTagType = Port` | `ExpressionSetConstraintObj.csv` | Relation is not bound to the bundle component |

**#3 is the one that bites.** With #1 present and #3 missing, the configurator offers the
product because the bundle says it is a component, then rejects it because the model has
no type for it. Nothing points at the constraint model.

`Type` associations reference a **Product2** (`01t` prefix); `Port` associations reference
a **ProductRelatedComponent** (`0dS` prefix).

### Ports are per bundle relation, not per type

Only types reachable as **bundle members** get a `Port`. The counts make the rule visible —
Port count tracks `relation` count, not `type` count:

| Model | Type | Port | `relation`s in the CML |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `QuantumBitComplete` | 29 | 28 | 28 |
| `Server2` | 41 | 40 | 40 |
| `QuantumBitBundle` | 33 | 28 | 29 |
| `QuantumBitPCM` | 12 | **0** | — |

`QuantumBitPCM` is the case that disproves any "every type needs a Port" rule: it is a
virtual-quote model whose types are cart line items, not bundle components, so it has
**zero** Ports and is correct that way.

Bundle's 29 relations against 28 Ports is the same distinction in miniature — the odd one
is `lineitems` on the `@(virtual = "true") Quote` container, a cart-level relation rather
than a bundle component, so it has no Port either.

**So the four-record rule above applies to bundle members.** For a cart-level or
virtual-quote type, records 1 and 4 (the PRC row and the `Port` association) do not
apply.

### Sequence is part of the composite key

`import_cml` resolves a Port association's PRC in two hops, and neither one reads the
SFDMU plan's PRC rows:

1. **Legacy Id → composite key**, built from the **constraint dir's own**
   `ProductRelatedComponent.csv` (`tasks/rlm_cml.py:842-854`), as
   `ParentProduct.Name | ChildProduct.Name | ChildProductClassification.Name |
   ProductRelationshipType.Name | Sequence`.
2. **Composite key → real Id**, matched against `ProductRelatedComponent` records
   **queried from the target org** (`tasks/rlm_cml.py:868-892`).

`dataset_dirs` contributes only candidate *names* — products, classifications and PRC
parents — and those merely scope the org lookups, here as
`WHERE ParentProduct.Name IN (…) OR Name IN (…)`. It never supplies a composite key.

**So the sequence in the constraint dir has to match the PRC row the org actually holds.**
The plan matters because it is what loads that row — which is why copying the sequence
from the plan is the right authoring move. But when a Port fails to resolve, **query the
org**; do not diff the two CSVs. An org whose plan was never loaded, or was loaded from a
different revision, disagrees with the plan on disk.

It fails loudly rather than silently — `ImportCML` logs `Could not resolve
ReferenceObjectId` per row and accumulates `unresolved_tags` — but **it does not fail
atomically**, and the distinction matters when you are recovering.

`create_record()` is called inline for every row as the loop walks the ESC list, so by the
time a failure is diagnosed the rows that *did* resolve are already in the org. Step 6
(delete the old ESC records) is skipped on a failed import, so the previous generation of
rows is still there too. The task says so itself: *"Import had errors -- skipping deletion
of old ESC records. Target org may contain a mix of old and new constraints."*

**Two failure modes. Both now fail loudly** — they did not always:

| Failure | Raises? | Org left holding |
|---|---|---|
| A reference will not resolve (bad `Sequence`, missing product) | **yes** (not in `dry_run`) | every pre-existing ESC row, plus whatever was created before the failure; blob **not** uploaded |
| `create_record()` fails but every reference resolved | **yes** (not in `dry_run`) | same |

Usually that means a *mix* of old and new — but not always: if every create failed there
are no new rows, and on a model with no prior rows there is no old generation to mix with.
Query the ESC set rather than assuming.

Both converge on `describe_esc_import_failure()` in `tasks/rlm_cml.py`, and steps 6-7 run
through `_finalize_esc_import()`. The raise happens *after* the "skipping deletion of old
ESC records" warning and *before* the blob upload, so the model is never uploaded over a
partial ESC set. **A `dry_run` logs the same diagnosis at error level and does not raise** —
it wrote nothing, so nothing is left behind.

> ⚠️ **Before this fix, the second mode exited 0.** `unresolved_tags` was empty so the raise
> never fired: the blob uploaded, `Import complete` logged, and the task returned success
> over a partial set. `prepare_constraints` runs `import_cml`, so a build could go green
> carrying a partial constraint model. If you are reading logs from an older build, an
> `Import complete` there does **not** mean every ESC row landed.

**A clean rerun cleans up after either failure.** The existing-ESC snapshot is taken fresh
at the top of every run (`WHERE ExpressionSetId = …`, unfiltered otherwise), so it captures
the old generation *and* the partial rows left by the failed run; a pass that resolves and
creates everything then deletes the whole snapshot. Fix the cause and rerun — you do not
have to clear the mix by hand.

What does not self-correct is a rerun that *also* fails: the delete is skipped again and
another partial generation layers on. So if the import errored, rerun until one pass is
clean.

A dry run surfaces the resolution warnings without touching the org, which is why it is
worth reading rather than just checking its exit code.

## Making a change reach an org

**`import_cml` uploads the blob; it does not redeploy the model.** If the target
`ExpressionSetDefinitionVersion` is already `Active`, the new model is stored and the org
keeps running the old one — and the import reports success.

```bash
# manage_expression_sets does NOT accept --org (see Known gaps) -- it uses the DEFAULT org.
# Set the default first so all three steps hit the same org.
cci org default <cci_alias>

# <Version>  = the ApiName from the discovery query, e.g. QuantumBitBundle_V1
# <DataDir>   = the model's directory under datasets/constraints/, from `ls -d`
# <PlanDir>   = the SFDMU plan that loaded the ESC's Product2/PRC rows into the org
#               (it supplies the names that scope import_cml's lookup queries)
cci task run manage_expression_sets -o operation deactivate_versions \
    -o version_full_names "<Version>"

cci task run import_cml --org <cci_alias> \
    -o data_dir <DataDir> \
    -o dataset_dirs "<PlanDir>"

cci task run manage_expression_sets -o operation activate_versions \
    -o version_full_names "<Version>"
```

<details><summary>Filled in for the QuantumBit bundle, as an example</summary>

```bash
cci task run manage_expression_sets -o operation deactivate_versions \
    -o version_full_names "QuantumBitBundle_V1"
cci task run import_cml --org <cci_alias> \
    -o data_dir datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitBundle \
    -o dataset_dirs "datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm"
cci task run manage_expression_sets -o operation activate_versions \
    -o version_full_names "QuantumBitBundle_V1"
```

</details>

`prepare_constraints` does this for you at steps 11-12; a standalone `import_cml` does
not. See below.

### How the flow handles it, and why step 11 looks redundant

`manage_expression_sets` is the right tool: `_update_version_status` queries
`ExpressionSetVersion` by `ApiName` and PATCHes `IsActive`
(`tasks/rlm_manage_expression_sets.py:527-591`) — the same record and field the Constraint
Builder UI toggles.

`prepare_constraints` orders it like this:

```
 7-10. import_cml  Complete, Server2, PCM, Bundle
11.    deactivate  -> QuantumBitComplete_V1, QuantumBitPCM_V1, QuantumBitBundle_V1, Server2_V1
12.    activate    -> Server2_V1, QuantumBitBundle_V1
```

Those names are the flow's current configuration, not a rule — read them from
`cci flow info prepare_constraints` rather than from here.

**Every version step 12 activates also appears in step 11 — deliberately.**
That is the invariant to preserve: `QuantumBitBundle_V1` and `Server2_V1` are both
activated, so both must be deactivated first. Steps 7–10 upload into a
version that may already be active, which stores the blob without redeploying the runtime
model; step 11 then deactivates Bundle and step 12 reactivates it, giving the
deactivate/reactivate cycle that makes the platform pick the new model up. Removing Bundle
from step 11 would make step 12 a no-op on an already-active version and the flow would
report success while the org kept running the old model. It is a no-op on a fresh build,
where versions are created inactive.

> Verified at step level on a scratch org: Bundle `true` → deactivated → `true`, with
> Complete and PCM left `false`. **Not yet verified end-to-end** — that a full flow run
> against an org with an already-active model carries a change through to the configurator
> still needs a real build, and is tracked separately.

**A standalone `import_cml` gets none of this** — it uploads and stops. That is the normal
way to ship a model change, so cycle the version yourself afterwards:

```bash
cci org default <cci_alias>   # manage_expression_sets does not accept --org, see Known gaps

# <Version> is the ApiName from the discovery query — e.g. QuantumBitBundle_V1,
# Server2_V1, or whatever the org actually reports as active for the model you changed.
cci task run manage_expression_sets -o operation deactivate_versions \
    -o version_full_names "<Version>"
cci task run manage_expression_sets -o operation activate_versions \
    -o version_full_names "<Version>"
```

Cycle **the version you imported into**. If several models are active, cycling an
unrelated one proves nothing and briefly deactivates a model something else may depend on.

or do the same in the UI: the Constraint Model record is the `ExpressionSet` record page
(`/lightning/r/ExpressionSet/<9QL…>/view`), its **Constraint Model Versions** related list
is `ExpressionSetVersion`, and opening a version launches **Constraint Builder**, whose
toolbar carries **Sync**, **Deactivate** and **Save**.

Salesforce documents the requirement:

> "If the table data is deployed when the constraint model is activated, and you add
> records to the table after constraint model activation, to fetch the new table data at
> runtime you must deactivate and reactivate the constraint model."
> — Help, *Import Object Data* (262)

> **Not yet investigated:** the builder's **Sync** button, which is distinct from
> activate/deactivate. Its effect is unknown — do not assume it is a no-op.

## Examples

### Add a product to a configurable bundle

Worked example — adding `QB-CMT-TKN-BND` to `QB-COMPLETE` in the `QuantumBitBundle` and
`QuantumBitComplete` models. Substitute your own model and product; the shape is the same
for any vertical.

```bash
# 1. Confirm the PRC row exists and note its Sequence (here: 25)
grep QB-CMT-TKN-BND datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm/ProductRelatedComponent.csv

# 2. Edit the BLOB (not the .cml): add a relation and a type next to the siblings
#      relation quantumbitdatabasetokencommitbounded : QuantumBitDatabaseTokenCommitBounded;
#      type     QuantumBitDatabaseTokenCommitBounded : LineItem;

# 3. Re-sync the reference copy
cp datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitBundle/blobs/ESDV_QuantumBitBundle_V1.ffxblob \
   scripts/cml/QuantumBitBundle.cml

# 4. Add Product2 + both ESC rows (Type and Port), reusing Sequence 25 on the PRC row
# 5. Dry run, then deactivate -> import -> activate (above)
```

### Read the deployed model back out of an org

```bash
URL=$(sf data query --use-tooling-api --target-org <sf_alias_or_username> \
  -q "SELECT ConstraintModel FROM ExpressionSetDefinitionVersion WHERE DeveloperName='QuantumBitBundle_V1'" \
  --json | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['result']['records'][0]['ConstraintModel'])")
INST=$(sf org display --target-org <sf_alias_or_username> --json | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['result']['instanceUrl'])")
TOK=$(sf org display --target-org <sf_alias_or_username> --json | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['result']['accessToken'])")
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" "$INST$URL" | grep "TokenCommitBounded"
```

---

## Validation Checks

Before calling a constraint-model change done:

1. `cci task run validate_cml -o cml_dir scripts/cml -o data_dir <dir>` → **0 errors**
   (warnings are noisy and largely pre-existing; the error count is the signal).
2. Blob and reference `.cml` byte-identical — **only for a model that ships one**
   (`QuantumBitPCM` does not): `diff -q <blob> scripts/cml/<Model>.cml`. A model with no
   reference copy skips this check; the blob is the artifact, so its absence is not a
   failure.
3. Dry-run import resolves your new rows to **real org Ids**, and you queried those Ids
   back to confirm they are the records you meant — not just that something resolved.
4. Deactivate → import → activate actually run, in that order.
5. `ConstraintModel` reads back with your change in it (recipe above). Note what this
   does **not** prove: `import_cml` writes that same field, so it confirms the upload was
   stored and nothing more. It cannot distinguish "stored" from "deployed".
6. Diff the **expected** set against the org rather than listing what is there — and
   **scope the query to the model you changed**. Models deliberately share most tags
   (Bundle is a graft of Complete plus PCM), so an unscoped query lets a tag missing from
   one model be masked by another model's row:
   ```bash
   sf data query --target-org <sf_alias_or_username> -q "
     SELECT ConstraintModelTag, ConstraintModelTagType
     FROM ExpressionSetConstraintObj
     WHERE ExpressionSet.ApiName = '<Model>'"
   ```
   then assert every product you expect has **both** a `Type` and a `Port` row.
7. **Exercise the configuration rules.** This is what proves the runtime model was
   rebuilt — nothing above distinguishes a deployed model from a stored one. It does
   **not** require the UI: activation only flips `IsActive`, and the model is compiled
   when config rules run, so POSTing the Product Configurator `configure` action with
   `executeConfigurationRules: true` against a quote line that uses the model exercises
   the same path headlessly. A valid model returns `success: true`,
   `solverStatus: "success"`, `errors: []`; an invalid one returns `Model '…' is invalid`.
   Full recipe: `datasets/constraints/README.md` → *Validating the combined model
   (headless)*.

## Known gaps

- **`manage_expression_sets` rejects `--org`** and runs against the default org. One
  instance of a repo-wide problem (102 of 193 custom tasks). `import_cml`, `export_cml`
  and `validate_cml`'s siblings do accept it.
- **`validate_cml`'s warning stream is not clean enough to gate on** — it emitted ~1,779
  warnings against the QuantumBit models at the time of writing, nearly all pre-existing
  "missing type association for leaf type". Treat the **error** count as the signal and
  check the warning count against a known-good baseline for the models you are touching.
- **A standalone `import_cml` never cycles the version.** `prepare_constraints` covers
  this at steps 11-12, but shipping a model change usually means running `import_cml` on
  its own — where the upload lands and nothing redeploys. There is no single task that
  does import-and-cycle.
- **No *passive* signal distinguishes "stored" from "deployed".** `ConstraintModel` is the
  upload field, so no query tells you the runtime rebuilt — you have to make the engine
  run. The configurator `configure` POST does that headlessly (see Validation check 7), so
  this is a gap in observability, not in automation: there is no status field to watch,
  but there is no need for a browser either.
- **`import_cml` still half-applies on failure** — but it no longer hides it.
  `create_record()` runs inline per row, so a failure leaves the rows that already resolved
  in place while the delete-old-rows step is skipped — "a mix of old and new constraints",
  in the task's own words. Both failure modes now raise (outside `dry_run`), and neither
  uploads the blob, so a partial ESC set can no longer ship under a model that references
  rows which never landed.
  A **clean** rerun clears the mix (the snapshot is retaken each run, so the delete on a
  clean pass removes the partial rows too); a rerun that fails again layers another partial
  generation. What remains unfixed is the half-apply itself: the writes are not staged, so a
  failure still leaves the org changed. Staging them (collect payloads, insert at the end,
  or roll back what was created) is the real fix. See
  [The four records a bundle member needs](#the-four-records-a-bundle-member-needs) →
  *Sequence is part of the composite key* for the full table.
- **The builder's `Sync` button is uninvestigated.**
