# AI Agent Skills — Discovery Index

These skills are **plain markdown files** usable by any AI agent (Cursor,
Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Windsurf, Aider, or any tool that
can read files). They live under `.cursor/skills/` for historical
reasons but have no Cursor-specific dependencies.

For the full project rules and safety guards, read `AGENTS.md` at the
repo root.

## How Skills Are Structured

Each top-level skill should include the sections below. **Quick Rules** is
present in every skill today and **DO NOT** in most; **Entry Conditions**,
**Examples**, and **Validation Checks** are the target structure for new skills,
and existing skills are being migrated to add them incrementally:
1. **Quick Rules** — 5-8 numbered rules at the top for fast reference
2. **DO NOT** — explicit safety constraints for that topic
3. **Entry Conditions** — when to read the skill and when to use adjacent guidance
4. **Main content** — tables, code examples, decision guides
5. **Examples** — concrete usage patterns
6. **Validation Checks** — commands and review checks to run before commit/PR
7. **Sub-files** — detailed reference split into separate files (read on demand)

For the full lifecycle checklist, read `skill-authoring/SKILL.md`.

## File-Specific Rules (Cursor Only)

Rules in `.cursor/rules/` auto-inject when Cursor edits matching files.
Non-Cursor agents can read these files directly or use the equivalent skill:

| Rule | Triggers On | Equivalent Skill |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `sfdmu-export-json.mdc` | `**/export.json` | `sfdmu-data-plans/SKILL.md` |
| `sfdmu-csv-data.mdc` | `datasets/sfdmu/**/*.csv` | `sfdmu-data-plans/SKILL.md` |
| `cci-task-definitions.mdc` | `cumulusci.yml` | `cci-orchestration/SKILL.md` |
| `cci-python-tasks.mdc` | `tasks/**/*.py` | `cci-orchestration/custom-task-authoring.md` |
| `apex-scripts.mdc` | `scripts/apex/**/*.apex` | `troubleshooting/SKILL.md` |
| `ux-templates.mdc` | `templates/**` | `repo-integration/SKILL.md` |
| `robot-tests.mdc` | `robot/**/*.robot` | `robot-testing/SKILL.md` |
| `doc-review.mdc` | `cumulusci.yml`, `tasks/**/*.py`, `datasets/sfdmu/**/export.json`, `datasets/sfdmu/**/*.csv`, `robot/**/*.robot`, `.cursor/skills/**/*.md` | `doc-consistency/SKILL.md` |
| `context-plans.mdc` | `datasets/context_plans/**/*.json` | `context-service/SKILL.md` |
