# Context Service — Authoring & Lifecycle

Read this when deciding **extend vs clone**, reasoning about **activation /
deactivation**, understanding **versioning** and **upgrade/Sync** across a
release, or debugging a lifecycle gotcha.

## The three definition types

| Type | Origin | Suffix / marker | Upgradable via Sync? | Edit? |
|------|--------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Standard** | Ships OOTB, file-based | `__stdctx` | n/a (is the base) | **No** — extend it |
| **Extended** | Custom layer on a standard base | `inheritedFrom` set | **Yes** — auto-upgrades, preserves mandatory mappings | Yes (additive) |
| **Custom / Cloned** | From scratch (`create: true`) or `clonedFrom` | neither | **No** | Yes |

**Extend, don't clone** (documented best practice): extending preserves the
base's mandatory mappings and keeps **Sync** working across releases; a clone
freezes at its point-in-time copy and must be re-reconciled by hand. Only
create-new when no standard base fits — e.g. `RLM_QuoteDocGenContext`
(`datasets/context_plans/DocGen/`, `"create": true`), which models a Quote →
Line hierarchy that no standard context provides.

## Node vs. attribute vs. tag vs. mapping — the authoring decision

The four building blocks map onto data-model concepts. Grounding in the
**Sales Transaction context** (`SalesTransactionContext__stdctx` → extended
`RLM_SalesTransactionContext`) — the most-used context in Revenue Cloud, and the
one nearly every additive plan in this repo targets:

| Block | Data-model analogue | In Sales Transaction |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Node** | an **entity / record level** in a hierarchy | `SalesTransaction` (the header) → `SalesTransactionItem` (the line) → `SalesTransactionItemDetail` → `SalesTrxnItemRateCardEntry` — a real **4-level**, 44-node tree |
| **Attribute** | a **value on that entity** | `SalesTransactionItem` carries **144 attributes** (132 `INPUTOUTPUT`, 9 `INPUT`, 3 `OUTPUT`) |
| **Tag** | the **name a consumer binds by** | every attribute a pricing procedure reads/writes is tagged; the tag name is the seam, not the SObject field |
| **Mapping (rule)** | the **binding to one SObject/field, per lens** | the `SalesTransaction` node binds to **6 different SObjects** across mappings — `Quote` (`QuoteEntitiesMapping`), `Order` (`OrderEntitiesMapping`), `SalesAgreement` (`SalesAgreementEntitiesMapping`), etc. |

### Which do I add?

- **New value on an entity that is already a node → add an *attribute* (+ tag +
  mapping).** This is the overwhelmingly common case. Example: the **RampMode**
  plan adds `RampMode__c` to the *existing* `SalesTransactionItem` node — **no new
  node**. You almost never add a node to Sales Transaction; its entity hierarchy
  already models the whole quote/order/agreement/asset/contract surface.
- **New entity / hierarchy level not yet modeled → add a *node*** (nested via
  `parentNodeName` for a child), **then** its attributes + tags + node/attribute
  mappings. This is the create-new path — e.g. DocGen's `Line` under `Quote`.
  Nodes must be created **parent-first**; depth is capped at **5** (Sales
  Transaction uses 4).
- **Make an existing attribute referenceable by an engine → add a *tag*** on it.
  An untagged attribute is invisible to expression sets / docgen.
- **Populate an attribute from org data → add a *mapping rule*** — **one per lens
  (mapping) you want it hydrated in.** RampMode adds `RampMode__c` twice: to
  `QuoteEntitiesMapping` → `QuoteLineItem.RLM_RampMode__c` **and** to
  `OrderEntitiesMapping` → `OrderItem.RLM_RampMode__c`. Same attribute, two
  lenses, because a quote line and an order line are different SObjects.

### Combinations — what yields *working* functionality

The blocks are independent, so a partial combo is the usual reason a change
"doesn't do anything":

| What you declared | Result |
|-------------------|--------|
| Attribute only | Inert — declared, but never hydrated and not referenceable |
| Attribute + mapping, **no tag** | Hydrated into the cache but **unreachable** by the expression set (no name to bind) |
| Attribute + tag, **no mapping** | Referenceable but **never populated** from data (runtime-input only) |
| **Attribute + tag + mapping (× each lens)** | ✅ Working recipe for *"surface a new field to pricing / docgen"* — what **RampMode** does |
| **Node + its attributes + tags + node-mapping + attribute-mappings** | ✅ Working recipe for *"model a new (child) entity"* — what **DocGen's `Line`** does |

**On the parent-child linkage:** the node **hierarchy** itself lives in Layer 1
(`parentNodeId` / `childNodes`). At the binding layer, traversal from a parent
record to its children is carried by **relationship-typed attributes** (e.g.
`SalesTransactionItemParent` on the item node, whose `parentNodeMappingId` points
back at the parent node mapping) — not by a field on the node-mapping shell. You
do not hand-author those on the standard base; they come with it. When you add a
plain value attribute, you are **not** creating a relationship — just a field
binding.

Standard RC contexts this repo extends (see the `extend_context_*` tasks):
Sales Transaction, Product Discovery, Cart, Billing, Fulfillment Asset,
Collection Plan Segment, Rate Management, Rating Discovery, Contracts, Contracts
Extraction, Asset. **Availability varies by edition** — the foundational ones
(Sales Transaction, Product Discovery) are always present; **Cart** and **plain
Contracts** (non-extraction) are the ones most likely to be absent on a lean
edition and skip. Confirm what a given org actually provisioned with
`list_contexts.py` before assuming a base exists.

**Edition-optional vs. always-present (`allow_skip_if_unavailable`).** Most
`extend_context_*` tasks set `allow_skip_if_unavailable: true` so they no-op
gracefully when the standard base context is not provisioned on the target
edition: Cart, Billing, Fulfillment Asset, Collection Plan Segment, Rate
Management, Rating Discovery, Contracts, Contracts Extraction. Three do **not**
set the flag and will hard-fail if their base is missing:
`extend_context_sales_transaction` and `extend_context_product_discovery` (both
foundational — always present, so the flag is unnecessary) and
`extend_context_asset` (`cumulusci.yml:698`). The Asset omission is an
**asymmetry**: Asset availability varies by edition, so if an Asset extend fails
on a lean edition, that is the likely cause — add `allow_skip_if_unavailable:
true` there to match the others, or gate the task with a `when:` edition guard.
This bites only on lean editions that lack an Asset context — on editions where
Asset is provisioned the omission is harmless.

## Task sequence (extend → apply → deploy)

The typical order when standing up context configuration on an org:

1. **`extend_context_*`** (live, Connect/SObject REST) — establish the extended
   layer on each standard base first. Run via the **`extend_context_definitions`**
   flow (`cumulusci.yml:3794`).
2. **`apply_context_*` / `manage_context_definition`** (live) — apply this repo's
   additive plans (attributes, mappings, tags, traversal hydration) onto those
   bases. These are standalone tasks, not currently bundled into a flow.
3. **`deploy_context_definitions`** (MDAPI, `cumulusci.yml:925`) — deploy the
   file-based `.contextDefinition` metadata under
   `force-app/main/default/contextDefinitions/`. Also a **standalone task**, not
   in a flow. Note: activation state and default-mapping designation are **not
   packageable**, so an MDAPI deploy still needs a follow-up activation step.

## Activation & deactivation

- **`IsActive` is version-level.** One version active at a time; a version needs
  a **default mapping** to activate. Each extended definition exposes exactly one
  active `ContextDefinitionVersion`.
- **In-place by default — but the "insert vs modify/delete" split is per-endpoint,
  not universal.** `manage_context_definition` and `apply_context_*` run with
  `deactivate_before: false` (`rlm_context_service.py`); the broad rule holds —
  `RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED` "Cannot modify/delete an active context definition" fires
  on many modify/delete paths — but the actual per-URL behavior on an active
  version is more nuanced (live-probed v67.0):

  | Op | Endpoint | On active |
  |---|---|---|
  | Insert new node/attr/tag/mapping-shell | Connect POST children of definition | **Allowed** |
  | `IsTransient` PATCH | SObject REST PATCH `ContextAttribute` | **Blocked** — `RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED` |
  | `isDefault` / mapping metadata PATCH | Connect PATCH `context-definitions/{id}/context-mappings` | **Blocked** — `RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED` |
  | Node-mappings PATCH (with partial children) | Connect PATCH `context-mappings/{id}/context-node-mappings` | **⚠ Silently destructive** — returns `isSuccess:true` + empty body, wipes sibling `ContextAttributeMapping` rows not re-emitted |
  | `MappedContextDefinition` PATCH | SObject REST PATCH `ContextNodeMapping` | **Allowed** (any direction) |
  | Traversal-hydration POST (`ContextAttributeMapping` + `ContextAttrHydrationDetail`) | SObject REST POST | **Allowed** |
  | Add tag POST | Connect POST `context-tags` | **Allowed** |
  | Leaf DELETE | SObject REST DELETE `ContextAttributeMapping/{id}` | **Allowed** |

  Practical rule: an *additive* plan (nodes/attrs/tags/mapping shells/traversal
  hydration/`MappedContextDefinition`) applies **in place on active** — this is
  what the build path relies on. A plan that flips `IsTransient` or re-points the
  default mapping needs deactivate-first (`deactivate_before: true` on the task,
  or `mutate_context.py --deactivate-first`). And a plan that PATCHes node-mappings
  with less than the full existing child set is worse than blocked — it silently
  destroys the omitted rows; either send the full children or use the granular
  `context-attribute-mappings` endpoint. To add **one** attribute→field binding,
  `mutate_context.py --add-mapping <Node.Attr> <mapping> <sObjectField>` posts the
  `ContextAttributeMapping` + `ContextAttrHydrationDetail` pair via SObject REST
  (runs on active, never touches siblings) — and is the only clean way to bind a
  **root**-node attribute, whose whole-body PATCH shape can't be expressed.
- **Deactivation is blocked while an active consumer references the definition**
  — ExpressionSet, ContextRules, PricingActionParameters, or a decision table.
  The deactivate PATCH fails with **`RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED`**; a definition with
  no active consumer deactivates cleanly. **Only *active* consumers block** —
  deactivating (or unlinking) the consumer first unblocks the definition. The
  platform error never names the blocking record, but the **ExpressionSet** link
  *is* queryable (see *Debugging a blocked deactivation* below); the other
  consumer types have no enumerating query, so trace those by type.
  Deactivating a definition a **pricing procedure** uses **breaks that
  procedure** — unlink/deactivate consumers first, in dependency order.
- **Activation requires a default mapping.** A version will not flip active
  unless one `ContextMapping` is flagged `isDefault:true`; otherwise the
  `isActive:"true"` PATCH fails with **`DATA_MAPPING_NOT_FOUND`**. Set it with a
  `PATCH .../context-mappings {"contextMappings":[{"contextMappingId":…,
  "isDefault":"true","name":…}]}` **before** activating — this is what
  `ExtendStandardContext._update_context_mappings` does, and what the standalone
  `apply_context_plan.py --default-mapping <name>` / `_ensure_default_mapping`
  do in the create + activate flow. The designation is **not packageable** (must
  be set via API/UI after an MDAPI deploy).

### Debugging a blocked deactivation

When a deactivate fails, an active consumer still references the definition.
To find it, look at each consumer type (deep SOQL is out of scope here — start
with the likely one for your change):

- **ExpressionSet / pricing procedure** — the most common blocker, **and the one
  consumer link you can enumerate directly.** The join object
  `ExpressionSetDefinitionContextDefinition` (queryable on the **regular data
  API** — the Tooling API rejects it with `sObject type … is not supported`)
  lists every ES wired to a definition:

  ```bash
  sf data query --query "SELECT Id, ExpressionSetDefinitionId, ContextDefinitionId, ExecutableContextDefinition \
    FROM ExpressionSetDefinitionContextDefinition WHERE ContextDefinitionId='<11O…>'" --target-org <alias>
  ```

  A core definition like `RLM_SalesTransactionContext` is typically wired to
  **many** ES (≈9 on a built org — every pricing/DocGen procedure), so this is
  the usual reason a whole-definition deactivate is refused. See
  `.cursor/skills/pricing-wiring/SKILL.md` and
  `.cursor/skills/expression-sets/SKILL.md` for the procedure side.
- **ContextRules / decision table** — a decision table whose input maps to a
  context node, or ContextRules referencing it. No enumerating query — trace by
  type.
- **PricingActionParameters** — pricing actions that name the context. No
  enumerating query.

Fix order: unlink/deactivate consumers in dependency order (consumer → context),
then deactivate the definition. Reactivate the definition before re-linking.

**Reversible ES detach/reattach recipe (live-verified v67.0).** When only an
`isTransient`/`remove-tag`/default-mapping edit needs a brief deactivation on a
core definition, detaching the ES links is faster and less disruptive than
deactivating each pricing procedure. The junction is `createable`/`deletable`
with two meaningful writable fields (`ExpressionSetDefinitionId`,
`ContextDefinitionId`; `ExecutableContextDefinition` is usually null), so the
round-trip fully restores the wiring:

1. **Back up** the links to a file: the query above with `--json > links.json`.
2. **Detach** — `sf data delete record --sobject ExpressionSetDefinitionContextDefinition --record-id <Id>`
   for each (count drops to 0 → definition is now deactivatable).
3. **Edit** — run `mutate_context.py --deactivate-first --reactivate --confirm`
   (or `delete_context.py`); it now succeeds.
4. **Reattach** — `sf data create record --sobject ExpressionSetDefinitionContextDefinition
   --values "ExpressionSetDefinitionId=<9QA…> ContextDefinitionId=<11O…>"` for each backed-up link.
5. **Verify** — the reattached rows get **new junction Ids** (non-semantic; the
   ES↔context *mapping* is what matters), so verify by comparing the sorted set
   of `ExpressionSetDefinitionId`s against the backup, not the junction Ids.

**Test-target caveat:** for a round-trip that needs deactivation to undo (e.g. an
`--add-tag` you plan to `--remove-tag`), **don't pick a wired core definition**
like `RLM_SalesTransactionContext` — the remove will strand mid-cycle behind the
ES block. Use an unwired/clone definition, or plan the detach/reattach up front.

## Versioning

**The platform enforces exactly one `ContextDefinitionVersion` per
`ContextDefinition` — a 1:1 singleton, not 1:N.**  Attempting to insert a
second version via SObject REST returns `MAX_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: "Version already
exists for this Context Definition"`. *(Live-verified v67.0.)*

The MDAPI type *appears* 1-to-many (`ContextDefinitionVersions` child
relationship, `ContextDefinitionVersion[]` in the type definition), and
`IsActive` + `StartDate`/`EndDate` fields suggest multi-version history was
designed — but the platform **runtime constraint blocks it**. There is **no
`IsLatest` and no `Status` field**, so do not assert one.

**What mutations do:** an additive Connect PATCH (`apply_context_*` /
`manage_context_definition`) and a deactivate/reactivate cycle both **bump
`VersionNumber` in place on the single version record** — they do *not* mint a
new version row. The record's `CreatedDate` precedes its `LastModifiedDate`;
the ID is stable across deactivate/reactivate/edit. Standard `__stdctx`
definitions expose **no queryable `ContextDefinitionVersion` rows** — only the
extended `RLM_*` layer does.

**Implication for code:** `contextDefinitionVersionList[0]` and an
`isActive`-preferring lookup always resolve to the same (only) version. Both
patterns are safe; the defensive `active_version()` helper exists for
forward-compatibility if the platform ever relaxes the singleton constraint,
but today they are equivalent.

There is **no "save as new version" verb** in the Connect API (public REST
reference lists only create/clone/extend, PATCH-by-id, and Upgrade); the only
version-crossing operation is Upgrade/Sync (below).

## Upgrade / Sync (across a release)

- `PATCH /services/data/v67.0/connect/context-definitions/upgrades` with
  `upgradeMode` ∈ **`Sync`** (merge platform changes, preserve custom artifacts),
  **`Preview`** (report only), **`Override`** (**destructive** — deletes custom
  artifacts, resets to the standard base). One definition at a time.
- **Prefer `Sync`.** Use `Preview` to see the delta first. Never run `Override`
  expecting it to be non-destructive.
- **262 upgrade note:** a **BillingContext duplicate-mapping cleanup** is
  required before Sync succeeds on the Billing context — resolve the duplicate
  mapping, then Sync.
- Sandbox → prod: validate the upgrade in a sandbox (Preview, then Sync), confirm
  consumers still resolve, then repeat in prod.

## Hydration, persistence & the mapping intents

A context definition is a **schema**; at runtime an engine (Pricing/BRE/DRO/
Billing) creates a **context instance** and moves data between the mapped
SObjects and the instance's attribute cache. Which direction the data flows is
governed by the mapping's **`intents`** (Connect `contextMappings[].intents`, a
`List<String>`; MDAPI `contextMappingIntents[].mappingIntent`, since v61) **and**
each attribute's **`fieldType`**:

| Intent | Direction | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **HYDRATION** | source → cache (read) | Run SOQL against the mapped SObject/field (honoring FLS) to **load** attribute values into the instance ("load cache from a data source"). |
| **PERSISTENCE** | cache → sink (write-back) | **Write** computed attribute values back out to the mapped SObject ("load the *sink objects* from cache"). The persist API takes a `targetMappingId` — the **same** mapping used for hydration — and commits the record tree via the **Composite Graph API** (`ALL_OR_NONE`). |
| **ASSOCIATION** | link | Link records/definitions **without** validating a DB relationship and **without hydrating** (the consuming service supplies hydration). The *most permissive* shape — the only intent that allows many-node→one-SObject and cross-node mappings. This is the intent on **cross-context / definition-to-definition** links (`SalesTransactionToAssetMapping`, `ContractToSalesTxnMapping`), which carry **zero node mappings**. |
| **TRANSLATION** | transform | Re-express a hydrated context through **another target mapping** (context→context / SObject-graph reshaping). Invoked via a `translate(contextId, mappingId)` operation, analogous to persist; runs in the SObject-graph persistence subsystem; SObject-mapping-only (not DMOs). |

**One binding record, two directions — there is NO separate persistence
structure.** `ContextAttrHydrationDetail` (`sObjectDomain` + `queryAttribute`) is
the **single** object that describes an attribute↔SObject.field binding, used for
**both** read and write. There is no `ContextAttrPersistenceDetail` /
`persistenceDetailList` — confirmed against the MDAPI `ContextDefinition` type and
the live GET (only `contextAttrHydrationDetailList` +
`contextAttrContextHydrationDetailList`, nothing persistence-specific). Persist
reuses the same bindings, run backward.

**Direction is gated by intent AND `fieldType`:**

| `fieldType` | On HYDRATION | On PERSISTENCE |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| `INPUT` | read into cache | — (never written) |
| `INPUTOUTPUT` | read into cache | written back |
| `OUTPUT` | — | written back (computed) |
| `AGGREGATE` | — | computed/rollup (not a plain field write) |

`isTransient: true` is **skipped on persist** regardless of `fieldType` (the
explicit per-attribute opt-out of write-back). `trace_context.py` classifies each
binding using exactly this table — `->` hydrate, `<-` persist, `<->` both.

- **The intent is a *gate*, not a config payload.** Adding/removing an intent
  enables/disables that operation for the mapping (a read-only context ships
  `intents:["HYDRATION"]`; adding `"PERSISTENCE"` is what enables the persist
  API). Multiple intents coexist — the 8 entity mappings on Sales Transaction
  carry all four; the 6 link mappings carry `["ASSOCIATION"]` only. The intent
  also gates which mapping *shapes* are legal at design time (ASSOCIATION allows
  many:1 / cross-node; PERSISTENCE and TRANSLATION are one-to-one only).
- **`writeThroughTags` is a *runtime* API, not a definition/mapping field**
  (`PATCH /connect/contexts/write-through-tags`, and an Apex
  `context.writeThroughTags(...)`). It writes attribute values **by tag name**
  into a live context instance. A context is read-only because its mapping
  **lacks the PERSISTENCE intent** — not because a `writeThroughTags` field is
  empty.
- **`ContextAttrHydrationDetail`** is the hydration query hop (≤1 per attribute
  mapping). Simple SOBJECT hydration is one detail (`sObjectDomain` +
  `queryAttribute`); a **relationship traversal** chains a parent detail → child
  detail (`parentDetailId`/`childDetails`) and must be built via **SObject REST**,
  not the Connect PATCH.
- **Note — `mappedField` is empty on inherited/standard definitions.** The real
  source field on an attribute mapping lives in
  `contextAttrHydrationDetailList[].queryAttribute` (+ `sObjectDomain`), **not**
  in a `mappedField` column (which is blank on everything inherited from a
  standard base). Any field↔tag tooling must read the hydration detail; a join on
  `mappedField` returns zero rows. This is what `trace_context.py` and `_model.py`
  read.
- **Hydration silently no-ops when the mapped SObject field is absent** — the
  big gotcha. Writing a `ContextAttrHydrationDetail` — via either the inline
  Connect node-mapping PATCH **or** a direct `ContextAttrHydrationDetail`
  SObject-REST POST — returns `success:true` with an id **but persists nothing**
  when the target `sObjectField` does not exist on the org. The GET then reports
  `hasHydrationDetail:false` even though the write "succeeded", and this happens
  identically whether the write came from the standalone scripts or the CCI task
  (it is a platform behavior, not a mapping-code bug). **Lesson:** a "hydration
  didn't take" failure is almost always a **missing field / build-order** problem
  — query `FieldDefinition` for the mapped field before blaming the mapping.

## Gotchas

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `JSON_PARSER_ERROR` on create | `primaryDomainObject` / `primaryObject` in the create payload — **or** a bare-date `startDate` | Remove the domain-object key; make `startDate` an **xsd:dateTime** (`"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"`), not `"2020-01-01"` |
| `DATA_MAPPING_NOT_FOUND` on activate | No mapping is flagged `isDefault:true` on the version | PATCH the default mapping before `isActive:"true"` (see *Activation & deactivation*); with the scripts, pass `--default-mapping <name>` or set `defaultMapping` in the plan |
| Hydration write "succeeds" but no rows persist | Mapped `sObjectField` does not exist on the org (phantom no-op) | Deploy the field / fix build order; verify with `FieldDefinition` (see *Hydration, persistence & the mapping intents*) |
| New field binds (data-layer rows exist) but the Connect GET / trace / Setup picker shows **"(no field bound)"** / `contextAttrHydrationDetailList: []` | **Running user lacks FLS on the mapped field.** The bind *persists* on the active version in place, but the **Connect aggregated GET honors FLS** and filters it out (live-verified v67.0). This — not a version recompile — is what the Setup-UI "deactivate/activate + refresh before the new field appears" behavior actually is | **Grant FLS** (add the field to the permission set that already ships the context's fields, with read) → it surfaces **immediately, no cycle, no definition change.** A deactivate/activate cycle does **not** fix a missing-FLS binding, so don't chase version cycles — FLS is the actual lever. *(Whether an FLS-hidden binding also affects hydration at engine runtime, or is purely a read-view artifact, is worth confirming on the target org if the field is engine-consumed — but it is moot in practice once FLS is granted.)* |
| Hydration disappears after a re-run | Connect PATCH `isDeleteExistingHydrationDetail` defaults **true** | Re-send hydration, or apply traversal hydration via SObject REST |
| `mappedContextDefinitionName` never sets | Connect PATCH silently ignores it | Set via **SObject REST** |
| Relationship traversal rejected on PATCH | Connect does not accept traversals | Use **SObject REST** (`childSObject`/`childSObjectField`) |
| Deactivate fails | An active consumer (ExpressionSet/ContextRules/PricingActionParameters/DecisionTable) references it | Unlink/deactivate consumers first |
| Pricing procedure breaks | Its context definition was deactivated | Reactivate; don't deactivate a consumed definition |
| **`RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED` "Cannot modify/delete an active context definition"** on a delete **or an in-place edit** | **The version is active** AND the endpoint enforces the block. Live-probed v67.0: **BLOCKED on active** — Connect PATCH `context-definitions/{id}/context-mappings` (any body, including `isDefault`/`description`), SObject REST PATCH `ContextAttribute` (`IsTransient`), Connect DELETE of any existing artifact. **NOT blocked on active** — Connect POST children (nodes/attrs/tags/mapping shells), SObject REST PATCH `ContextNodeMapping` (`MappedContextDefinition`), SObject REST POST `ContextAttributeMapping`+`ContextAttrHydrationDetail` (traversal), SObject REST DELETE `ContextAttributeMapping/{id}` | **Deactivate first, then edit/delete.** `delete_context.py --deactivate-first` (delete) or `mutate_context.py --deactivate-first --reactivate` (edit) does this in one run; `manage_context_definition -o deactivate_before true` for a plan that edits existing artifacts. See the matrix in *Activation & deactivation* above for the full per-endpoint picture |
| **Node-mappings PATCH silently wipes sibling `ContextAttributeMapping` rows on an active version** — returns `isSuccess:true` + empty body, no error, but rows not re-emitted in the payload disappear | Connect PATCH `context-mappings/{id}/context-node-mappings` has **whole-body-replace semantics** — an omitted child is interpreted as a delete. Deactivating first does *not* stop this (it's not blocked; it's destructive). Live-verified v67.0 | Re-emit the full existing `contextAttributeMappings` list in the PATCH body, or — to add a single binding — use `mutate_context.py --add-mapping` (SObject-REST POST pair, never touches siblings, and the only clean way to bind a root-node attribute) or the granular `context-attribute-mappings` (`ATTR_MAPPING_COLLECTION`) endpoint one row at a time |
| `TransactionType` mapping change ignored | Inherited from the standard base; the task skips it | Leave it; it comes from the base |
| Orphan definition after a failed create | Payload-create has **no full rollback** on partial failure | Inspect with `describe_context.py`; delete/clean up the orphan before retrying |
| Context tag rejected / collides | A tag equals a decision table's label/API name | Rename the tag |
| **`DUPLICATE_VALUE` "Tag name already exists for this definition"** on a tag POST | **Tag names are unique per *definition*, not per attribute** (live-verified v67.0) — the same name cannot be used on two different attributes, even as an intended shared alias | Pick a distinct name. (A bare tag name is therefore a globally unambiguous handle for an ES; that 1:1 name→attribute map is the whole point) |
| Definition `name` rejected | Spaces / special chars in `name` | Alphanumeric `name`; use a separate DisplayName |
| **`INVALID_API_INPUT` "the custom artifact name … must have an '\_\_c' suffix in an extended context definition"** at INSERT (POST of a node/attribute/tag on an extended base) | The `__c` suffix is **platform-enforced at creation on a standard/extended base**, not just a downstream/naming nicety — a suffix-less custom artifact is **rejected outright** | Add `__c` to the custom artifact name. The offline validator errors on this for non-create plans, so it is caught before you hit the API |
