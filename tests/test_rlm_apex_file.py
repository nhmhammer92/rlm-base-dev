Offline invariants for tasks/rlm_apex_file.FileBasedAnonymousApexTask.

    python tests/test_rlm_apex_file.py

No org and no CumulusCI install required -- the task module degrades gracefully
when CumulusCI is absent, and every check here is pure string handling against
debug-log text captured verbatim from a real `sf apex run --json` response.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Two defects shipped in this task and neither was visible from its output:

1. It extended SFDXBaseTask -- documented as "call the sfdx cli with params and
   NO org" -- leaving `salesforce_task` False. cci builds the --org option from
   that flag, so `--org <alias>` was rejected outright and the task could only
   ever run against the default org, without logging which org that was.
2. It logged the script's output at debug level behind a 50-line cap. Since the
   head of an Apex debug log is the whole script echoed back as
   "Execute Anonymous:" lines, a 500-line validator burned the entire cap on
   source echo. A PASSING run therefore printed nothing at all, and the task
   communicated only by throwing.

Both are the kind of regression that reads as "working" -- the task still exits
0 -- so they need a test that asserts on the parsing, not on the exit code.
