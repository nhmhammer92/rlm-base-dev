Offline regression tests for the decision-table refresh path.

Every assertion here exists because the thing it checks was BROKEN and shipped, or —
in the flow-shape case — was broken in a draft and caught only by hand. None of it
needs an org or a CumulusCI install: both task modules degrade on ImportError, the
same property `tests/test_rlm_apex_file.py` relies on.

    python tests/test_decision_table_tasks.py

Modelled on `tests/test_rlm_apex_file.py`, which exists solely because
FileBasedAnonymousApexTask shipped with `salesforce_task = False`. That defect class
then recurred twice more in this feature, which is what this file is for.

# it invisibly. Checked by name against the real flag list, which needs no engine at all.
#
# ⚠ Match the WHOLE reference, not just `project__custom__<name>`. A malformed PREFIX —
# `project__custom_rating`, one underscore short — produces no match for the narrow pattern,
# so an unknown-flag scan finds nothing to complain about and the typo sails through as a
# falsy Undefined. Extracting every `<namespace>.<attribute>` and requiring project_config
# attributes to be exactly `project__custom__<declared flag>` closes that hole.
#
# ⚠ Scanned across EVERY flow, not just this one. The marginal cost is one extra loop and
# widening it is what found the psg_debug defect below on the first run.
# ⚠ Validate the COMPLETE org_config reference, not just the namespace. Allowlisting
# `org_config` wholesale lets `org_config.scrtch` through — and CCI's OrgConfig resolves an
# unknown attribute to None rather than raising, so under Jinja2 that typo is falsy and the
# guarded step is silently skipped. That is bit-for-bit the defect class this check exists to
# catch, just in the other namespace. Verified live 2026-07-27: `org_config.scrtch` -> None.
# CumulusCI puts exactly two names in the when: context (flowrunner.py:511-513), and these are

# ships ENFORCED rather than blocked on an undecided question. Tracked as issue #331.
#
# ⚠ Scoped to (flow, step, flag), NOT to the bare name. A name-scoped allowlist forgives the
# flag in all 198 clauses across 46 flows — measured: re-gating refresh_dt_prm_pricing onto
# psg_debug, which would silently stop that step running in any org, broke zero checks. These
# two sites are forgiven; a third reference anywhere is a failure.
# ⚠ EMPTY, and it must stay empty. CCI discards a `when:` on a `flow:` step (see the check
# below), so such a guard reads as load-bearing while doing nothing. The seven that existed
# were removed rather than kept as documentation — issue #333. Every child step already
# re-guarded on the same flag (4/4, 3/3, 10/10, 2/2, 3/3, 6/6, 7/7), so the removal changed

#
# Each silent path would leave a stale tuple that then forgives whatever nested-flow step later
# occupies that slot. Measured as two edits, each individually correct: fix site 29 properly,
# then land a NEW misplaced guard there — 87/87, exit 0. Binding the child name also stops a
# swapped child from inheriting the exemption (measured: swapping in another flow passed).

    round 16, on both interpreters:

      FALSE POSITIVE — `<flag> == "acme"` on a flag declared `'qb'` was reported as a constant,
      because "acme" was never in the domain. That is precisely how you gate a step on a

      list flag (no falsy member) and for any numeric comparison (`TypeError` against a bare
      `object()`, reported as though the GUARD were malformed).

      FALSE NEGATIVE — `_implies` reuses this domain, so a child guard `== "qb" or == "acme"`
      under parent `== "qb"` passed 89/89 while firing at `product_dataset='acme'`, where the
      parent does not. A child running in exactly the org the discarded parent guard excluded
      is the precise safety basis the whole allowlist rests on. That is the dangerous
      direction, and it is the same defect class round 15's check was added to close — one
      type along. "Has a guard" was too weak; "implies over an incomplete domain" is too weak
