"""Offline invariant tests for the QuantumBit multicurrency usage-rating data.

Self-contained — no pytest required (matches this repo's lightweight test
convention; see tests/test_context_plan_validator.py). Run from the repo root
with base Python:

    python tests/test_qb_multicurrency_data.py

Exits 0 when all checks pass, 1 otherwise. Reads only the committed CSVs in
``datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/{qb-rating,qb-rates,qb-pricing}`` — no org needed, so
this is safe to run in CI and as a pre-merge gate.

Each check corresponds to a defect that actually shipped (or nearly did) during
the multicurrency work, so the suite is a regression net rather than a
restatement of the data:

* ``tier_rce_has_adjustment``  — a Tier-type RateCardEntry with no
  RateAdjustmentByTier makes ``activate_rates`` fail the whole build with
  "Specify at least one tier adjustment for a Rate Card Entry of type tier".
* ``pack_products_have_no_purp`` — the platform REJECTS a
  ProductUsageResourcePolicy on a ``UsageModelType=Pack`` product
  (INVALID_INPUT). Two such rows silently failed to load on every build.
* ``commitment_purp_has_no_periods`` — the platform REJECTS a rating frequency
  or aggregation policy on the PURP of a commitment product; a commitment
  discounts the anchor's rating rather than rating anything itself. Ten such
  rows shipped and silently failed to load, leaving the org with 10 of the 20
  PURP rows the plan declares.
* ``every_pur_has_rate_card_entry`` — a ProductUsageResource with no rate card
  entry raises "No effective rate card entry available" in the Usage Product
  Validator (QB-CMT-TKN-FLAT shipped this way).
* ``currency_uom_prerequisite`` — a rate is denominated by its
  RateUnitOfMeasure, so a per-currency RateCardEntry cannot load unless a
  matching ``CURRENCY``-class UnitOfMeasure exists in qb-rating.
* ``currency_coverage_uniform`` — a currency missing an entry cannot rate at
  all; there is no runtime conversion from the USD row.
* ``percentages_currency_neutral`` / ``bounds_not_converted`` — percentage
  adjustments and tier bounds (consumption quantities) must never be converted.
* ``money_conversion_sane`` — converted money must track
  CurrencyType.ConversionRate, and tiered rates must stay distinct after
  rounding (whole-yen rounding once flattened four JPY tiers onto ¥1).
* ``rates_derived_from_base`` — every non-base rate must equal the generator's
  derived value exactly. ``money_conversion_sane`` deliberately tolerates
  0.2x–5x for hand-tuned demo rates, which let six hand-seeded GBP/JPY
  placeholders (e.g. GBP storage at the unconverted USD 10 instead of 7.48)
  survive an expansion and rate wrong in a live org.
* ``period_ordering_descending`` — the platform requires Billing >= Rating >
  Accumulation. Three equal Monthly periods fail the "Create Empty Summaries"
  batch with "Specify values for the Billing Period, Rating Period and Usage
  Accumulation Period parameters in descending order", which blocks the entire
  usage-rating pipeline: no UsageSummary, no rating, no billing.
