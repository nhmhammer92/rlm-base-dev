## The GET vs PATCH shape gap

The Context Service Connect API is **not shape-symmetric**: the JSON a GET
returns is **not** the JSON the same URL's PATCH accepts. Concretely:

- **GET response** carries *response-only* fields the PATCH rejects
  (`baseReference`, `contextAttributeName`, `parentNodeMappingId`, `dataType`,
  `sourceObject`, `mappedContextTag`, …).
- **GET response** flattens hydration into top-level lists
  (`contextAttrHydrationDetailList`, `contextAttrContextHydrationDetailList`);
  the PATCH expects them **nested** under `hydrationDetails` with a different
  key name (`contextAttrHydrationDetails`, `contextAttrContextHydrationDetails`).
- **GET response** exposes SObject-REST-style fields (`mappedField`) even on
  the Connect surface; the Connect PATCH rejects them.

Rebroadcasting a GET row unchanged as the PATCH body will fail with
`JSON_PARSER_ERROR: Unrecognized field "<name>"` on the first response-only
field the parser encounters.

**Implication for callers doing a read-modify-write:** you must **project**
the GET row down to the PATCH accept-shape before re-emitting it. See
[`_project_attribute_mapping_for_patch`](../../scripts/context_service/_apply.py)
for the reference implementation.

## Endpoint accept-shapes

### Connect PATCH `context-mappings/{id}/context-node-mappings`

The primary "update node mapping" surface — and the one with the
**whole-body-replace hazard**: any `contextAttributeMappings` list that omits
an existing sibling row is interpreted as a request to delete that sibling
(the platform still returns `isSuccess: true`). Live-verified silent-destroy
on active versions.

> **Two-layer guard in `_apply.py`.** (1) `_merge_existing_attribute_mappings`
> folds every existing non-inherited sibling back into the body so the
> whole-body-replace endpoint sees a complete child set. (2) The accept-shape
> pre-flight (`validate_node_mapping_patch_shape`) now **blocks a PATCH** whose
> body fails validation, raising `ContextClientError` before the wire — because
> we have *already* merged siblings into that body, and firing a payload the
> platform rejects after the merge risks the exact silent sibling-loss the merge
> exists to prevent. A **POST** stays log-only (no siblings to lose; the platform
> rejects a bad POST loudly).

**Body:**

```json
{
  "contextNodeMappings": [
    {
      "contextNodeId":         "11a…",
      "contextNodeMappingId":  "11b…",
      "sObjectName":           "QuoteLineItem",
      "mappedContextNodeId":   "11a…",
      "attributeMappings": {
        "contextAttributeMappings": [
          {
            "contextAttributeId":          "11c…",
            "contextInputAttributeName":   "MyAttr__c",
            "contextAttributeMappingId":   "11d…",   /* PATCH one; omit for POST */
            "mappedContextAttributeName":  null,
            "mappedContextTagName":        null,
            "isKey":                       false,
            "isValue":                     true,
            "sequence":                    1,
            "hydrationDetails": {
              "contextAttrHydrationDetails": [
                { "sObjectDomain": "QuoteLineItem", "queryAttribute": "Description" }
              ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Node-mapping shell required fields:** `contextNodeId`, `contextNodeMappingId`
(for PATCH), `sObjectName` are required on **every** node mapping. The fourth,
`mappedContextNodeId`, is required **only for a child node mapping** — it points
at the parent node. A **root** node mapping legitimately carries
`mappedContextNodeId: null` (there is no parent to point at); requiring it there
is a false positive. Omitting a genuinely-required field raises
`INVALID_DEFINITION: "Invalid mapping for given context"` (a generic message
that *does not name the missing field*).

> **Root-node null exception (live-verified 2026-07-08).** On
> `RLM_SalesTransactionContext`, the `SalesTransaction` root node mapping stores
> `mappedContextNodeId: null`. The pre-flight shape validator
> (`validate_node_mapping_patch_shape`) therefore treats `mappedContextNodeId`
> as required only for nodes the caller identifies as non-root (via
> `root_node_ids`, from `_payload.collect_root_node_ids`). Before this fix the
> validator flagged the null unconditionally and **fatally refused** a valid
> additive root-node PATCH — the whole-body-replace path could never add a
> mapping to a root node. For additive root-node bindings, prefer the granular
> SObject-REST path (see below) over the whole-body PATCH.

**Attribute-mapping accept-list** (fields the endpoint accepts; every other
key raises `JSON_PARSER_ERROR: Unrecognized field`):

- `contextAttributeMappingId` — required for PATCH; omit for POST of a new mapping
- `contextAttributeId`
- `contextInputAttributeName` (writable form; **not** `contextAttributeName`)
- `mappedContextAttributeName`
- `mappedContextTagName`
- `isKey`, `isValue`, `sequence`
- `hydrationDetails` (nested — see below)

**Response-only fields (never emit these back):** `baseReference`,
`contextAttributeName`, `parentNodeMappingId`, `dataType`, `sourceObject`,
`mappedContextTag`, `contextAttrHydrationDetailList` (flat),
`contextAttrContextHydrationDetailList` (flat), `mappedField`.

**Hydration nesting:** the GET returns hydration as *flat* top-level lists;
the PATCH expects them *nested* under `hydrationDetails` with different keys:

| GET (response) shape                                | PATCH (accept) shape                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `contextAttrHydrationDetailList: [{...}]`           | `hydrationDetails.contextAttrHydrationDetails: [{...}]`        |
| `contextAttrContextHydrationDetailList: [{...}]`    | `hydrationDetails.contextAttrContextHydrationDetails: [{...}]` |

Per-hydration-entry accept-list:

- SObject-domain entries (`contextAttrHydrationDetails`): `sObjectDomain`,
  `queryAttribute` only.
- Context-source entries (`contextAttrContextHydrationDetails`):
  `queryAttribute` (source `ContextAttribute` id), `parentAttributeMappingId`
  (source `ContextAttributeMapping` id) only.

All other entry keys (`baseReference`, `contextAttrHydrationDetailId`,
`mappedAttributeDataTypeInfo`, `childDetails`, …) are response-only.

**Inherited-row rule:** GET rows with `baseReference` containing `__stdctx/`
are inherited from the standard base. Re-emitting them raises
`INVALID_INPUT: "An Inherited mapping for ContextAttribute: <name> already
exists…"`. Filter them out before the merge. See `_is_inherited_row`.

**Verb rule:** the endpoint accepts both `POST` (new node mappings) and
`PATCH` (existing ones). The primary caller inspects each node mapping —
if *any* has a `contextNodeMappingId` the write becomes a `PATCH`; otherwise
a `POST`.

**Many-to-one plan constraint (not a payload-shape issue but a common
follow-on error):** binding a custom attr to a `QuoteLineItem` field that is
already bound by a standard inherited attribute raises
`INVALID_DEFINITION: "Many-to-one mapping isn't allowed"`. Pick a field the
inherited base doesn't already map.

---

### Connect PATCH `context-definitions/{id}/context-mappings`

Used for mapping-level metadata (`description`, `isDefault`, etc.) — **not**
for attribute-mapping edits. The typical fields:

```json
{
  "contextMappings": [
    {
      "contextMappingId": "11j…",
      "isDefault":        true,
      "description":      "…"
    }
  ]
}
```

Active-version behavior: **BLOCKED**. Setting `isDefault` on an active
version fails with `RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED: "Cannot modify/delete an active
context definition"`. Deactivate first.

---

### SObject REST PATCH `sobjects/ContextAttribute/{id}`

Used to flip `IsTransient` on an existing `ContextAttribute`:

```json
{ "IsTransient": true }
```

Active-version behavior: **BLOCKED** — same
`RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED` error as the Connect mapping PATCH. Deactivate first.

---

### SObject REST PATCH `sobjects/ContextNodeMapping/{id}`

Used to set/clear `MappedContextDefinition` on a node mapping:

```json
{ "MappedContextDefinition": "11O…" }   /* or null to clear */
```

Active-version behavior: **ALLOWED** (silent success on null→value,
value→value, value→null).

---

### SObject REST POST `sobjects/ContextAttributeMapping` / `ContextAttrHydrationDetail`

Used by the traversal-hydration flow (`_apply_traversal_hydration`). Body is
the standard SObject REST create shape:

```json
{
  "ContextNodeMappingId":  "11b…",
  "ContextAttributeId":    "11c…",
  "MappedField":           "Account.Name",
  "IsKey":                 false,
  "IsValue":               true
}
```

Note the **SObject REST uses `MappedField`** (SObject-REST-style) — this is
the same-domain concept the Connect PATCH expresses via nested
`hydrationDetails.contextAttrHydrationDetails[].queryAttribute`. **Do not
confuse the two.** Emitting `mappedField` on the Connect endpoint raises
`JSON_PARSER_ERROR`.

Active-version behavior: **ALLOWED** (POST of new artifacts is on the
active-version allow-list, universally).

---

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Connect `PATCH context-mappings/{id}/context-node-mappings` (attr-mappings) | ⚠ SILENTLY DESTRUCTIVE | `isSuccess:true` + wipes sibling `ContextAttributeMapping` rows not re-emitted. **Mitigated** by the sibling-merge in `_apply.py`, and a shape-violation now **blocks the PATCH** (raises before the wire; POST stays log-only). |
| Connect `PATCH context-definitions/{id}/context-mappings` (mapping metadata) | BLOCKED             | `RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED`. Deactivate first.                             |
| SObject REST `PATCH sobjects/ContextAttribute/{id}` (`IsTransient`)          | BLOCKED             | `RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED`. Deactivate first.                             |
| SObject REST `PATCH sobjects/ContextNodeMapping/{id}` (`MappedContextDefinition`) | ALLOWED         | Silent success.                                                       |
| Connect `POST context-definitions/{id}/context-tags` (add tag)               | ALLOWED             | INSERT of a new artifact.                                             |
| SObject REST `POST sobjects/ContextAttributeMapping`                         | ALLOWED             | INSERT of a new artifact.                                             |
| SObject REST `POST sobjects/ContextAttrHydrationDetail`                      | ALLOWED             | INSERT of a new artifact.                                             |
| SObject REST `DELETE sobjects/ContextAttributeMapping/{id}`                  | ALLOWED             | Leaf-row delete.                                                      |
| Connect `POST context-definitions/{id}/context-node-mappings` (new NM shell)| ALLOWED             | INSERT of a new artifact.                                             |
| Connect `POST context-definitions/{id}/context-attributes` (new attr)       | ALLOWED             | INSERT of a new artifact.                                             |

**Rule of thumb:** the platform lets you **INSERT** new artifacts on an
active version (POST of nodes, attributes, mappings, tags, hydration-detail
leaves), but **MODIFY / DELETE** an existing one is blocked — with two
exceptions:

1. `SObject REST PATCH sobjects/ContextNodeMapping/{id}` is silently
   allowed (independent of the Connect PATCH block).
2. The Connect node-mapping PATCH is not blocked — but its
   whole-body-replace semantics turn a partial payload into a silent delete
   of the omitted rows. This is worse than a hard block.

**To add one attribute→field binding, prefer the granular op, not the PATCH.**
`scripts/context_service/definition/mutate_context.py --add-mapping
NODE.ATTR MAPPING SOBJECT_FIELD` posts a `ContextAttributeMapping` +
`ContextAttrHydrationDetail` pair via SObject REST — both on the
active-version INSERT allow-list, and it never touches sibling rows. This
is the sanctioned way to bind an attribute on an **active** definition,
and it is the **only** clean way to add a binding to a **root** node: the
whole-body Connect PATCH cannot express a root mapping (its
`mappedContextNodeId` is legitimately null — see the shell-fields section
above) and the shape guard now refuses that PATCH before the wire.

**Partial-failure repair.** The two POSTs are not atomic: a CAM can land while
its `ContextAttrHydrationDetail` POST fails, leaving an *orphan CAM with no
source field* (the binding exists structurally but hydrates nothing). Re-running
`--add-mapping` for the same attribute detects this — it **reuses the existing
CAM** and POSTs only the missing hydration detail (never a second CAM). A
complete binding is reported as a no-op; a genuinely incomplete one is reported
as a *repair*. Note that many standard CAMs are **legitimately** hydration-less
(identity / translation mappings carry no source field by design), so the
classifier only ever acts on the one attribute you name — it never mass-repairs
a definition. See `_existing_attr_binding` / `plan_add_mapping` in `_mutate.py`.

## Common rejections and how to resolve them

Every error below was observed live against the mutation endpoints. `<field>` /
`<name>` are placeholders for the platform's actual token.

| Symptom                                                                 | Root cause                                                        | Resolution |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `JSON_PARSER_ERROR: Unrecognized field "baseReference"`                 | Response-only field re-emitted on PATCH                           | Project the row down via `_project_attribute_mapping_for_patch`; strip all response-only fields |
| `JSON_PARSER_ERROR: Unrecognized field "contextAttributeName"`          | Response-only mirror of `contextInputAttributeName`               | Use `contextInputAttributeName` on writes |
| `JSON_PARSER_ERROR: Unrecognized field "mappedField"`                   | SObject REST field emitted on Connect PATCH                       | Use nested `hydrationDetails.contextAttrHydrationDetails[{sObjectDomain,queryAttribute}]` on Connect |
| `JSON_PARSER_ERROR: Unrecognized field "contextNodeName"`               | Response-only field on node-mapping shell                         | Use `contextNodeId` + `sObjectName` |
| `INVALID_DEFINITION: "Invalid mapping for given context"`               | Node-mapping shell missing a required id, or the payload references an artifact the definition doesn't know about | Always include the three structural fields — `contextNodeId`, `contextNodeMappingId`, `sObjectName`. Add `mappedContextNodeId` **only for a child** node-mapping (it points at the parent); a **root** node-mapping's is legitimately null, so omit it there. Verify ids against a fresh `fetch_detail`. For a root binding, skip the PATCH entirely and use the granular `--add-mapping` op. |
| `INVALID_INPUT: "An Inherited mapping for ContextAttribute: <name> already exists…"` | Re-emitted an inherited (`baseReference` contains `__stdctx/`) attribute mapping row | Filter inherited rows via `_is_inherited_row` before the merge |
| `INVALID_DEFINITION: "Many-to-one mapping isn't allowed"`               | Two attributes binding to the same SObject field                  | Plan-authoring issue, not a payload issue — pick a different `sObjectField` or repurpose the existing binding |
| `RECORD_UPDATE_FAILED: "Cannot modify/delete an active context definition"` | Modify/delete of an existing artifact on an active version    | Deactivate first (see A2 shared lifecycle guard); reactivate after |
| `MAX_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: "Version already exists for this Context Definition"` | Attempted to insert a second `ContextDefinitionVersion`         | The version is a 1:1 singleton — deactivate/reactivate bumps `VersionNumber` in place; do not create a second version |
| PATCH returns `isSuccess: true` but siblings vanish                     | Whole-body-replace semantics on Connect node-mapping PATCH        | Re-emit ALL existing children (P2 fix), or — to add a single binding — use the granular `mutate_context.py --add-mapping` op (SObject-REST POST pair, never touches siblings) instead of the PATCH |

---

## Where the fixes live in code

- **Read-shape → write-shape projection:** `_project_attribute_mapping_for_patch`
  in `scripts/context_service/_apply.py` — the read side of the P2 fix.
  Emits the accept-shape (allow-listed keys + nested hydration).
- **Field allow-lists:** `_ATTR_MAPPING_PATCH_FIELDS`,
  `_SOBJECT_HYDRATION_ENTRY_FIELDS`, `_CONTEXT_HYDRATION_ENTRY_FIELDS` in
  `_apply.py`. Keep in sync with the [Attribute-mapping accept-list](#connect-patch-context-mappingsidcontext-node-mappings)
  section above.
- **Inherited-row detection:** `_is_inherited_row` in `_apply.py`.
- **Sibling merge:** `_merge_existing_attribute_mappings` in `_apply.py` —
  the write side of the P2 fix. Given a plan payload with `contextMappings`
  and a `detail` snapshot, folds every existing non-inherited sibling back
  into the PATCH so the whole-body-replace endpoint sees a complete child
  set.
- **Primary builder (write-shape source of truth):**
  `_payload.translate_mapping_rules` — the plan→PATCH translator, whose
  emitted shape is what this doc describes. Any change to accept-shape rules
  must be reflected in both `translate_mapping_rules` and the projection
  helpers.
- **Active-version guard:** `_guard_active_for_patch` in `_apply.py` — routes
  the two Connect/SObject PATCH hazard points through a deactivate-first
  wrapper when `deactivate_before=True` was passed to `apply_plan`.
- **Destructive-PATCH block:** in `_apply_mapping_updates` (`_apply.py`), a
  non-empty shape-check `violations` list on `verb == "PATCH"` raises
  `ContextClientError` before `self.t.request(verb, …)` — refusing to fire a
  post-merge body the platform would reject. POST-verb violations remain
  log-only.

---

## Runtime instance mutation shapes (require `ContextServicePilot` on a GA org)

These are the **runtime** (context-instance) mutation bodies, distinct from the
design-time definition-management PATCHes above. All are flat (no wrapper object).

### `PATCH /connect/contexts/attributes` — update attribute values

```json
{
  "contextId": "<opaque-hex-contextId>",
  "nodePathAndAttributes": [
    {
      "nodePath": {"dataPath": ["<recordId>"]},
      "attributes": [
        {"attributeName": "SalesTransactionName", "attributeValue": "New Value"},
        {"attributeName": "Status", "attributeValue": "InReview"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `dataPath` contains **record IDs** from root to target, NOT node names.
  `["<quoteId>"]` = root record; `["<quoteId>", "<qliId>"]` = child.
  An empty `[]` or node-name-based dataPath silently no-ops (returns
  `isSuccess:true` but no value changes). Live-verified: both REST and Apex
  confirm **only record IDs mutate values** (262 / v67.0, pilot + non-pilot).
- Uses **attribute names** (not tag names).
- **NOT** wrapped in `updateContextAttributesInput` — the wrapper is rejected:
  `JSON_PARSER_ERROR: Unrecognized field "updateContextAttributesInput"`.
- **REST and Apex use the SAME key and shape**: `nodePathAndAttributes`
  (parsed JSON for REST; native `List<Map<String,Object>>` for Apex). The
  stringified `nodePathAndUpdatedValues` key ALWAYS throws
  `UnexpectedException` in direct Apex — it is only for the Flow invocable
  adapter (which deserializes it internally and uses tag names, not attribute
  names).

### `PATCH /connect/contexts/write-through-tags` — write values by tag

```json
{
  "contextId": "<opaque-hex-contextId>",
  "nodePathAndTagValues": [
    {
      "nodePath": {"dataPath": []},
      "tagValues": [
        {"tagName": "SalesTransactionName", "tagValue": "Written via Tag"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Uses **tag names** (distinct namespace from attribute names).

### `POST /connect/contexts/persist-records` — persist to mapped SObjects

```json
{"contextId": "<opaque-hex-contextId>", "targetMappingId": "11j…"}
```

- Flat — **NOT** wrapped in `contextPersistInput`.
- Returns `{"referenceId": "16P…"}` (async). **The `referenceId` IS the
  `AsyncOperationTracker.Id`** (exact equality) — poll
  `SELECT Id,Status,Response FROM AsyncOperationTracker WHERE Id = '<referenceId>'`.
  A dirty persist returns `Status='Completed'` **with** a populated `errorNodes`,
  so "Completed" alone is not success. `persist_context_instance.py` /
  `context_session.py --persist` poll this automatically and exit non-zero on a
  confirmed failure (see `runtime-and-persistence.md` → Persistence).

### `POST /connect/contexts` — create (hydrate)

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "contextDefinitionId": "11O…",
    "mappingId": "11j…",
    "contextScope": "SESSION"
  },
  "data": "<stringified JSON payload>"
}
```

- `contextScope` is optional (omit → `REQUEST` default, request-local ~15 s).
- `SESSION` requires `ContextServicePilot` permission; survives across separate calls.
- `data` is a **JSON string** (not a nested object).
