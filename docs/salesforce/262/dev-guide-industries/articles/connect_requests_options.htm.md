Properties
:   | Name | Type | Description | Required or Optional | Available Version |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | `actionContext​Code` | String | The code of the action context used to log explainability for a specific execution of an expression set. Note Note To exclude decision explanations for expression set version steps from action logs, ensure that you exclude the `actionContextCode` and `explainabilitySpecName` properties from the payload. | Optional | 55.0 |
    | `effectiveDate` | String | The date from which an expression set comes into effect. The date format is yyyy-mm-dd’T’hh:mm:ss’Z. Note Note Multiple versions of an expression set can exist with different date ranges. For example, Version 1 is effective before December 2019, and Version 2 is effective from January 2020 to the present. If you specify `effectiveDate` as "2019-03-15T00:00:00Z", Version 1 is executed. If you do not specify `effectiveDate`, the currently active version, Version 2, is executed. | Optional | 55.0 |
    | `explainability​Spec​Name` | String | The name of the explainability specification that is used to log explainability for a specific execution of an expression set. Note Note To exclude decision explanations for expression set version steps from action logs, ensure that you exclude the `actionContextCode` and `explainabilitySpecName` properties from the payload. | Optional | 55.0 |
    | `useDatesOnly` | String | Specifies that only the date portion (yyyy-mm-dd) of the value of effectiveDate field is to be used at the time of execution. | Optional | 55.0 |
