## Product Catalog & Discovery

| Feature | Tier | Description | Demo |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Product Discovery with Constraint Rules** | GA | Constraint Rules enforce product compatibility and surface recommendations in real time. Auto Save & Non-Blocking UI: products added directly to a transaction without leaving discovery. Transaction Preview shows existing quote lines inside discovery. | Product Discovery with Constraint Rules |
| **Product Variants** | GA | Define and manage base products with their specific product variants (color, size, material). Enables consistent variant experience across B2B Commerce ↔ Revenue Cloud quote-to-cash. | Product Variants |
| **Enhanced Currency Display Precision (Decimal Currency Value Scale)** | GA | Configure up to 6 decimal places for unit-level prices and discount fields on Product Discovery, Quote, and Order pages. Default and minimum is 2. **Note:** only Unit Pricing and Unit Adjustment fields support high scale; final total fields still truncate to 2. | Unit Currency Decimal Scale |

---

## Salesforce Pricing

| Feature | Tier | Description | Demo |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CSV Based Decision Tables** | GA | Decision tables sourced from CSV uploads. Supports >30 inputs and >5 outputs (was limited). **Limitations:** no versioning in initial release; sObject-dependent pricing elements (Attribute-Based Pricing, multi-output resolution) not supported; max 100,000 rows per CSV DT, max 500 CSV DTs per org, max 10 versions per DT, max 10,000 rows per version. **Setup:** Create Decision Table with `Type = CSV` → upload CSV → Activate → add to pricing recipe → map to pricing element → activate procedure. | CSV Based DT Demo |
| **Pricing General Enhancements** | GA | (1) Hover added to Revenue Operations Console showing Date/Time. (2) Currency column added to Revenue Ops Console display. (3) 100 default tags supported in Map Line Items element (was 50). (4) Map Line Item element now allowed in Parallel Execution. | TBA |

---

## Product Configurator

| Feature | Tier | Description | Demo |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Group and Ramp Segment Scope Rules** | GA | Extends Advanced Configurator to support transaction scope rules applicable to Quote Groups and Ramp Segments. Previously, scope rules failed to work when groups were present on quotes — particularly impactful for group ramps. | Group Scope Rules |
| **Product Loader and Default Component** | GA | (1) Automatic inclusion of default components from product catalog when importing product bundles. (2) New `@productField` annotation to load standard or custom Product fields directly into CML attributes — supports constraints on standard & custom product fields. | Product Loader |

---

## Transaction Management

| Feature | Tier | Description | Demo |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Guided Ramp Schedule Generation with Trial and Prorated Segments** | GA | Replaces slow manual cloning for multi-year ramp deals. Supports free/trial segments + stub periods at start/end. **Setup:** Revenue Settings → Turn On "Multiple Ramp Schedules per Transaction" + "Trial Segments for Group Ramp Schedules". Sales Reps initiate via "Create Ramp Schedule" Action. **Example use case:** 60-month yearly deal with 30-day trial; 1-month trial + 11-month subscription. | (TBD) |
| **Product Ramp Selection** | GA | OOTB discovery flow updated — Ramp Selection moved to start of process. Users define scope (Add to Current vs Subsequent segments) before entering Product List Page. Fixes the prior limitation where "Save and Exit" only persisted products to current segment group. | (TBD) |
| **Early Renewal for Ramped Asset** | GA | Renew a ramped asset ahead of schedule — start a new (often larger/longer) subscription. Specify a future "Renewal Start Date" even mid-segment; renewal quote replaces remainder of existing ramp schedule with new ramp segments. **Use cases:** end 3-year ramp after 2 years for renegotiated 2-year contract; consolidate ramped + non-ramped assets in single renewal quote. | (TBD) |

## Items still pending master-PDF arrival

When the 262 master Help compendium PDF becomes available (not yet published by Salesforce as of 2026-05-22), use it to fill in:

- All `(TBD)` feature descriptions and configuration steps
- Demo URLs for every feature row
- Upgrade guidance for 262 (post-Spring-'26 → Summer-'26 transition)
- Known issues and limitations for 262
- Detailed configuration for items currently described only by their high-level highlight

The structure of this index is set; the gaps are content-only. Once the master arrives, this becomes the authoring input for `docs/enablement/262/` exercises.

> **Partial substitute available now:** the per-article Help snapshot at `docs/salesforce/262/help/articles/` (935 articles, captured 2026-05-11 / 2026-05-12 — see `.cursor/skills/revenue-cloud-docs/SKILL.md`) covers most of what the compendium PDF will eventually consolidate. Where a `(TBD)` row in this index has an obvious matching Help article, agents grounding new content should cite the snapshot article rather than waiting for the PDF.
