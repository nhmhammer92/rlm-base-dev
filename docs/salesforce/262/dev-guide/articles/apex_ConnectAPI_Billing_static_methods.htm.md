#### Usage

Use this method to adjust an outstanding invoice balance or rectify errors in an invoice.
Pass a list of invoice lines to credit. Keep these considerations in mind when you use this
API.

- The request must contain at least one invoice line. Each invoice line must have the
  invoice line’s ID, the amount to credit, and any optional tax details. The invoice lines
  must be a part of the invoice passed in the resource.
- The amount to credit must not exceed the charge or adjustment amount of an individual
  invoice line.
- The request body's credit amount inclusive of taxes must not exceed the target invoice
  line's amount inclusive of taxes, except for taxes calculated through an external tax
  service.
- The request body's total credit amount inclusive of taxes calculated through an external
  tax service must not exceed the outstanding invoice balance, which is also inclusive of
  taxes.

This method creates and posts a credit memo. The credit memo has one credit memo line for
each invoice line passed in the API request. The invoice’s balance is then reduced by a
value equal to the credit memo’s balance. This API modifies the balance of a posted invoice
or invoice line based on the specified credit application level for your org. See [Apply Credits to Posted Invoices or
Invoice Lines](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.billing_setup_credit_application_level.htm&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)").

You need the Generate Invoices From Billing Schedule API permission
set to use this method.

period between the billing schedule's next billing date and the invoice's target date.

or Processing status.

#### API Version

method.

Billing schedules include critical details such as the amount to be billed, next billing
date, and status. An invoice can be associated with one or more billing schedules. When an
invoice is generated or posted, the billing schedules are updated to reflect the accurate
state of the invoice. The billing schedules associated with an invoice are marked in the
`Error` status if any of the invoicing processes have
errors. Use this method to recover the invoice associated with the billing schedules in the
`Error` or `Processing` status.

#### Requires Chatter

No

#### Signature

`public static ConnectApi.VoidPostedCreditMemoOutputRepresentation voidPostedCreditMemo(ConnectApi.VoidPostedCreditMemoInputRepresentation VoidPostedCreditMemoInput, String creditMemoId)`

```

#### Parameters

VoidPostedCreditMemoInput
:   Type: [`ConnectApi.VoidPostedCreditMemoInputRepresentation`](./apex_connectapi_input_void_posted_credit_memo.htm.md "Input representation of the details of a credit memo to be voided.")
:   Input representation of the details of a credit memo to be voided.

creditMemoId
:   Type: String
:   Required. ID of the credit memo record in posted status to be voided.

#### Return Value

Type: [`ConnectApi.VoidPostedCreditMemoOutputRepresentation`](./apex_connectapi_output_void_posted_credit_memo_output.htm.md "Output representation of the request to void a posted credit memo.")

### voidPostedInvoice(invoiceId)

Void a posted invoice to rebill the customer, if necessary.

#### API Version

62.0

#### Requires Chatter

No

#### Signature

`public static ConnectApi.RevenueAsyncRepresentation
voidPostedInvoice(String invoiceId)`

#### Parameters

invoiceId
:   Type: String
:   ID of the posted invoice to be voided.

#### Return Value

Type: [`ConnectApi.RevenueAsyncRepresentation`](./apex_connectapi_output_revenue_async.htm.md "Output representation of the result of the API request with the request identifier.")

#### Usage

You need the Void a Posted Invoice API permission set to use this
method.

This method changes the invoice status from `Posted` to `Void In Progress`. The invoice
remains in the `Void In Progress` status until the credit
is applied and financial fields are recalculated on the invoice’s related billing period
items and billing schedule. The invoice status changes to `Voided` after all recalculations are completed.

Keep these considerations
in mind when you use this method.

- The balance and total amount on the invoice must be equal. If these amounts aren’t equal
  due to payments or credits, the API request fails.
- You can’t call other APIs on an invoice with the `Void In
  Progress` status. You also can’t update the invoice fields.
- You can void only the most recently posted invoice on a billing schedule.
- To void an invoice that has payments or credits, use the [Credit Memo
  Unapply (POST)](./connect_resources_credit_memo_invoice_application_unapply.htm.md "HTML (New Window)")  API.

Credit Memos
:   The void process creates a credit memo, which contains one credit memo line for each
    invoice line, including tax lines. For example, if the invoice line has a balance of
    US$20, the related credit memo line has a balance of $20. The credit memo’s balance is
    then allocated to the invoice header’s balance, reducing it to zero. A credit memo
    invoice application is created to record the details of the void process.

Negative Invoice Lines
:   If an invoice has negative invoice lines that aren’t converted to a credit memo, you
    can use this endpoint to void the posted invoice.
