# domainComputation Annotation

`domainComputation` is a CML annotation that specifies
how the domain of a model element is determined, either by using a fixed domain or by
computing the domain dynamically during configuration.

`domainComputation` annotation specification: Variable
and Relationship

| Annotation | `domainComputation` |
| --- | --- |
| Applicable to | Variable and Relationship |
| Value Type/Values | true, false |
| Description | `If domainComputation annotation is not explicitly specified, the engine sets it implicitly as false for the variable, and true for a relationship` If the `domainComputation` annotation is specified as `true`, the variable or relationship domain is dynamically determined based on the configuration and constraint logic.  If the `domainComputation` annotation is specified as `false`, the variable domain is fixed. |

## Example 1

In this example, the `domainComputation` annotation is not specified for the variable (voltage) of the
`GeneratorSet` type. The model contains the
constraints.

```
type GeneratorSet {
    @(defaultValue = "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)")
    string dutyRating = ["Emergency Standby Power (ESP)", "Prime Power (PRP)", "Continuous Power (COP)", "Data Center Continuous (DCC)"];
    string voltage = ["220/380", "240/416", "347/600", "255/440", "277/480", "2400/4160", "7200/12470", "7621/13200", "7976/13800"]
    constraint(dutyRating == "Continuous Power (COP)" -> voltage != "220/380");
    constraint(dutyRating == "Data Center Continuous (DCC)" -> voltage == "255/440");
}
```

## Example 2

In this example, the `domainComputation` annotation is explicitly specified as false for the variable
(voltage) of the `GeneratorSet` type. The model contains
the constraints.

```
type GeneratorSet {
    @(defaultValue = "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)")
    string dutyRating = ["Emergency Standby Power (ESP)", "Prime Power (PRP)", "Continuous Power (COP)", "Data Center Continuous (DCC)"];
    @(domainComputation = false)
    string voltage = ["220/380", "240/416", "347/600", "255/440", "277/480", "2400/4160", "7200/12470", "7621/13200", "7976/13800"];
    constraint(dutyRating == "Continuous Power (COP)" -> voltage != "220/380");
    constraint(dutyRating == "Data Center Continuous (DCC)" -> voltage == "255/440");
}
```

## Example Description and Configurator Result

In example 1, the `domainComputation` annotation is not
explicitly specified for the `voltage` variable, but the
system considers it as `false` by default. In example 2,
the `domainComputation` annotation is explicitly defined
as `false`. As a result, the system remains the variable
domain unchanged `(["220/380", "240/416",
"347/600", "255/440", "277/480", "2400/4160",
"7200/12470", "7621/13200", "7976/13800"])` and
executes the constraints:

If the `dutyRating` is selected with the `"Continuous Power (COP)"` value, the `voltage` is pre-populated with the next possible value from
the variable domain `("240/416")` to satisfy
the constraint.

If the `dutyRating` is selected with the `"Data Center Continuous (DCC)"` value, the `voltage` is pre-populated with the `"255/440"` value to satisfy the constraint.

## Example 3

In this example, the `domainComputation` annotation is explicitly specified as `true` for the variable (`voltage`) of the `GeneratorSet` type. The
model contains the
constraints.

```
type GeneratorSet {
    @(defaultValue = "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)")
    string dutyRating = ["Emergency Standby Power (ESP)", "Prime Power (PRP)", "Continuous Power (COP)", "Data Center Continuous (DCC)"];
    @(domainComputation = true)
    string voltage = ["220/380", "240/416", "347/600", "255/440", "277/480", "2400/4160", "7200/12470", "7621/13200", "7976/13800"];
    constraint(dutyRating == "Continuous Power (COP)" -> voltage != "220/380");
    constraint(dutyRating == "Data Center Continuous (DCC)" -> voltage == "255/440");
}
```

## Example Description and Configurator Result

In example 3, the `domainComputation` annotation is
explicitly specified as `true` for the `voltage` variable. As a result, the system updates the
variable domain based on the constraint logic.

If the `dutyRating` is selected with the `"Continuous Power (COP)"` value, the voltage is
pre-populated with the next possible value from the variable domain `("240/416")` to satisfy the constraint. The variable
domain is updated to exclude the `"220/380"`
value.

If the `dutyRating` is selected with the `"Data Center Continuous (DCC)"` value, the `voltage` is pre-populated with the `"255/440"` value to satisfy the constraint. The variable domain is
updated to contain only the `"255/440"`
value.

## Example 4

In this example, the `domainComputation` annotation is not specified for the relationship
(temperatureSensors). The model contains the
constraints.

```
type GeneratorSet {
    @(defaultValue = "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)")
    string dutyRating = ["Emergency Standby Power (ESP)", "Prime Power (PRP)", "Continuous Power (COP)", "Data Center Continuous (DCC)"];
    relation temperatureSensors : TemperatureSensor[0..1];
    constraint(dutyRating == "Continuous Power (COP)" -> temperatureSensors[BearingTemperatureSensor] == 0);
    constraint(dutyRating == "Data Center Continuous (DCC)" -> temperatureSensors[StatorTemperatureSensor] == 0);
}
type TemperatureSensor;
type BearingTemperatureSensor : TemperatureSensor;
type StatorTemperatureSensor : TemperatureSensor;
```

## Example 5

In this example, the `domainComputation` annotation is explicitly specified as `true` for the relationship (temperatureSensors). The model
contains the constraints.

```
type GeneratorSet {
    @(defaultValue = "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)")
    string dutyRating = ["Emergency Standby Power (ESP)", "Prime Power (PRP)", "Continuous Power (COP)", "Data Center Continuous (DCC)"];
    @(domainComputation = true)
    relation temperatureSensors : TemperatureSensor[0..1];
    constraint(dutyRating == "Continuous Power (COP)" -> temperatureSensors[BearingTemperatureSensor] == 0);
    constraint(dutyRating == "Data Center Continuous (DCC)" -> temperatureSensors[StatorTemperatureSensor] == 0);
}
type TemperatureSensor;
type BearingTemperatureSensor : TemperatureSensor;
type StatorTemperatureSensor : TemperatureSensor;
```

## Example Description and Configurator Result

In example 4, the `domainComputation` annotation is not
explicitly specified for the `temperatureSensors`
relationship, but the system considers it as `true` by
default. In example 5, the `domainComputation` annotation
is explicitly specified as `true` for the relationship.
As a result, the system updates the relationship domain based on the constraint logic.

- If the `dutyRating` is selected with the `"Continuous Power (COP)"` value, the system
  re-computes the relationship domain and excludes the `BearingTemperatureSensor` product to satisfy the constraint. The `StatorTemperatureSensor` product remains and can be selected
  in scope of the `GeneratorSet` bundle product;
- If the `dutyRating` is selected with the `"Data Center Continuous (DCC)"` value: the system
  re-computes the relationship domain and excludes the `StatorTemperatureSensor` product to satisfy the constraint. The `BearingTemperatureSensor` product remains and can be
  selected in scope of the `GeneratorSet` bundle
  product.

## Example 6

In this example, the `domainComputation` annotation is explicitly specified as `false` for the relationship (`temperatureSensors`). The model contains the
constraints.

```
type GeneratorSet {
    @(defaultValue = "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)")
    string dutyRating = ["Emergency Standby Power (ESP)", "Prime Power (PRP)", "Continuous Power (COP)", "Data Center Continuous (DCC)"];
    @(domainComputation = false)
    relation temperatureSensors : TemperatureSensor[0..1];
    constraint(dutyRating == "Continuous Power (COP)" -> temperatureSensors[BearingTemperatureSensor] == 0);
    constraint(dutyRating == "Data Center Continuous (DCC)" -> temperatureSensors[StatorTemperatureSensor] == 0);
}
type TemperatureSensor;
type BearingTemperatureSensor : TemperatureSensor;
type StatorTemperatureSensor : TemperatureSensor;
```

## Example Description and Configurator Result

In example 6, the `domainComputation` annotation is
explicitly specified as `false` for the relationship. As
a result, the system remains the relationship domain unchanged and executes the
constraints:

If the `dutyRating` is selected with the `"Continuous Power (COP)"` value, the system displays
both `BearingTemperatureSensor` and `StatorTemperatureSensor` products in scope of the `GeneratorSet` bundle product. The `BearingTemperatureSensor` product cannot be selected based on the constraint.

If the `dutyRating` is selected with the `"Data Center Continuous (DCC)"` value, the system
displays both `BearingTemperatureSensor` and `StatorTemperatureSensor` products in scope of the GeneratorSet
bundle product. The `StatorTemperatureSensor` product
cannot be selected based on the constraint.
