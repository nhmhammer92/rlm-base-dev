# Constraint Modeling Language

Constraint Modeling Language (CML) is a domain-specific language that defines models
for complex systems. For product configuration, constraint models describe real-world entities
and their relationships to each other.

Constraint models enforce business logic declaratively, without the need for extensive code
in a general-purpose programming language. In Product Configurator, a product designers or
admin create a constraint model in CML, then Constraint Rules Engine compiles the CML code.
The constraint model enforces requirements in a product configuration to comply with the
specified constraints.

To build a constraint model in CML, use this basic workflow.

- Create global properties and settings that are header-level declarations in CML that
  define the foundational, fixed values for the entire constraint model. They’re crucial for
  setting up the core configuration environment and ensuring reusability across the
  model.
- Create variables to define the properties or characteristics of a type. Variables can hold
  different kinds of data, such as strings, numbers, or lists, and can be calculated from
  other variables and values. In Revenue Cloud, variables represent product fields, product
  attributes, and sometimes context tags. See [Create a Context Definition](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.context_service_create_context_definitions.htm&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)")
  in Salesforce Help.
- Define types, which represent entities or objects in the model. Types are the building
  blocks of CML. They're similar to classes in object-oriented programming. In Revenue Cloud,
  types represent standalone products, bundles, product components, and product classes.
- Define relationships that describe how different types are associated with each other. In
  Revenue Cloud, relationships represent the product structure in a bundle. For example, the
  root product has a relationship with its components.
- Apply constraints to define logical restrictions, and enforce rules and conditions on
  types, variables, and relationships.

In Product Configurator, use the Visual Builder and CML Editor in Constraint Builder to
create constraint models with CML.

See the linked topics for information on working with CML, including detailed code
examples.

- **[Modeling a Generator Set](./cml_constraint_model_example_modeling_a_generator_set.htm.md)**  
  The Constraint Model for a Generator Set examples use CML to define a technical power configuration, illustrating concepts such as calculated variables, enforcement of external standards, and component selection based on requirements.
- **[Core Concepts](./cml_cml_core_concepts.htm.md)**  
  Constraint Modeling Language (CML) includes components that cover high-level global configurations to specific data types and constraints.
- **[Core Concept Examples](./cml_core_concept_examples.htm.md)**  
  These examples illustrate core Constraint Modeling Language (CML) concepts including type, relationships, constraints, and so on.
- **[Annotation Examples](./cml_annotation_examples.htm.md)**  
  Constraint Modeling Language (CML) annotations are labels that you add to parts of a model, such as types, variables, relationships, and constraints. Annotations control how these elements are shown and how they behave in the configurator. Annotations help fine-tune the configurator and the constraint engine without changing the actual structure of the model.
- **[Constraint Modeling Language (CML) Best Practices](./cml_cml_best_practices.htm.md)**  
  To prevent performance degradation or unexpected behaviors when the constraint engine executes CML code, follow these practices when writing code.
- **[Business-Centric Constraint Modeling Language (CML) Guidelines](./cml_business-centric_cml_guidelines_quantity_and_aggregation_fun.htm.md)**  
  Constraint Modeling Language (CML) must accurately calculate the total sum or aggregate of specific attributes like quantity or userCount across child components, especially in complex configurations requiring group-level aggregation
- **[Debugging Constraint Modeling Language (CML)](./cml_debugging_cml.htm.md)**  
  To debug constraint models and troubleshoot performance issues, enable debug logging in Apex and set the debug log level to FINE.
- **[Model Structure](./cml_appendix_model_structure.htm.md)**  
  The tables on the following pages show the structure for the constraint model in Core Concept Examples.
