# Create Standalone Billing Schedules (POST)

Generate billing schedules from any internal or external transaction
by using context service.

You can create a billing schedule from any sObject such as WorkOrder, Cart, Order,
Opportunity, and insurance policy. Or, you can also generate billing schedules from order
items.

The Create Standalone Billing Schedules (POST) API uses the StandaloneBillingContext context
definition to hydrate the context of the transaction. The context definition
includes these mappings.

- The TransactionMapping maps the fields of the transaction to the attributes of the
  Transaction node.
- The BSGEntitiesMapping maps the attributes of the Billing Schedule node, the Billing
  Schedule Group node, and Billing Schedule Group Relationship node to the fields of the
  corresponding Salesforce objects.

For the StandaloneBillingContext context definition to hydrate all the required data, transaction
data for the mandatory context tags are required. Here are the topics that mention
the mandatory and optional tags, sample transaction details, and sample payloads for
various types of transactions.

- [One-Time New Sale Transaction](./connect_requests_billing_schedule_input_for_one_time_new_sale.htm.md "Understand the required values and key considerations before you create a billing schedule for a new sale transaction with the OneTime selling model type.")

  Transaction](./connect_requests_billing_schedule_input_for_early_renewal.htm.md "Early Renewal ends the current term at an effective date and starts a renewed term to a new end date, creating two billing schedules in one request. The request creates a negative segment for the remaining original term and a positive segment for the renewal term.")
- [Canceled
  Transaction](./connect_requests_billing_schedule_input_for_cancellation.htm.md "Cancel an entire billing schedule from a specified date. Specify only the cancellation date and billing schedule group identifier.
