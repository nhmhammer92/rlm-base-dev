# Pricing Waterfall (GET)

Get the persisted price waterfall that stores the process logs.
Price waterfall provides insights into every step of the pricing process.

If price waterfall persistence is disabled from Salesforce Pricing Setup in your org, this
API doesn't return the waterfall details. You can view the waterfall details in the [Pricing API](./connect_resources_headless.htm.md "HTML (New Window)") or [Price Context API](./connect_resources_price_context.htm.md "HTML (New Window)") response if
price waterfall is enabled in Salesforce Pricing Setup.

## Advanced Price Logs

You can set up advanced price logs to capture
exception details for complex pricing elements. The API response captures input and output
values to trace any exceptions. Refer to the diagnostic data available in the price
waterfall details to identify and fix performance issues. See [Advanced Price
Logs](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.pricing_advanced_price_log_settings.htm&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)").
