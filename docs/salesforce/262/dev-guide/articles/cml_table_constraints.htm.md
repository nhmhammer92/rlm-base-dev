# Table Constraints

The table constraint in Constraint Modeling Language (CML) is used to define a set of
valid combinations of values for two or more attributes. These combinations are specified in
rows within the constraint definition.

The table constraint has this syntax:

```
table(variable, …, variable, {value, .. value}, …, {value, …, value});
```

Each row inside {} defines a valid combination of values.

## Example: Table Constraint

In this example:

- Variables: The attributes `Voltage` and `DutyRating` are listed as the columns for the table.
- Table Rows: Each row defined within the curly braces ({}) specifies a valid combination.
  For instance, `{"7976/13800", "Continuous Power
  (COP)"}` is a valid pairing.
- Enforcement: If a user attempts to select a high voltage (`"7976/13800"`) while choosing a Prime Power rating (`"Prime Power (PRP)"`), the table constraint is violated, and the engine
  displays the error message: "Selected Voltage is not compatible with the required Duty
  Rating."

```
// --- Component Types ---
type GeneratorSet {
// 1. Attributes whose values must align according to the table
string Voltage = ["220/380", "277/480", "7976/13800"];
string DutyRating = ["Prime Power (PRP)", "Continuous Power (COP)", "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)"];
// 2. Table Constraint
// Defines valid combinations where Voltage and DutyRating are mutually dependent.
constraint validOperationalModes(
table(
Voltage,
DutyRating,
{"220/380", "Prime Power (PRP)"},
{"220/380", "Continuous Power (COP)"},
{"220/380", "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)"},
{"277/480", "Prime Power (PRP)"},
{"277/480", "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)"},
{"7976/13800", "Continuous Power (COP)"}
),
"Selected Voltage is not compatible with the required Duty Rating."
);
}
```

## Import Data from a Salesforce Object to Populate a Table Constraint

Import data from a standard or custom Salesforce object to use in a table constraint in a constraint model. The imported data populates the columns and rows in the table constraint in CML, and saves you the step of manually entering the data.

To import data from a Salesforce object, first assign Read, Create, Edit, and Delete
permissions for the object to the Constraint Rules Engine Licenseless permission set. See
[Import Data from Salesforce Objects
to Use in Constraint Models](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.product_configurator_import_object_data.htm&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)") in Salesforce Help.

In CML, use the SalesforceTable keyword and the syntax shown here to import data from a
Salesforce object. This example uses the `GeneratorSet`
type to constrain the calculated running capacity (`gc_runningKw`) based on a user's selection of the nominal output (`Nominal_Power_Output`), referencing an external Salesforce
custom object named PowerCst\_\_c.

## Example: Imported Table Constraint

```
type GeneratorSet {
// 1. Attribute storing the user-selected power output (String)
string Nominal_Power_Output = ["100 kW", "300 kW", "500 kW", "700 kW"];
// 2. Attribute storing the resulting Running kW (Decimal, calculated)
@(configurable = false, defaultValue = "0")
decimal(2) gc_runningKw;
// Constraint ensures the pairing of Nominal_Power_Output and gc_runningKw is found in the imported Salesforce table.
constraint(
table(
Nominal_Power_Output, gc_runningKw,
SalesforceTable("PowerCst__c","Nominal__c,Running__c")
)
);
}
```

## Explanation of the Imported Table

The table constraint ensures that the selected values for `Nominal_Power_Output` and `gc_runningKw` must
form one of the valid combinations defined in the external source.

- Table (`Nominal_Power_Output`, `gc_runningKw`, ...): These are the CML attributes whose
  values must correlate. They define the columns of the required combination table.
- Salesforce Table ("`PowerCst__c",
  "Nominal__c,Running__c`"): This function keyword directs the constraint engine
  to import data from the Salesforce custom object PowerCst\_\_c.
- Field Mapping: The fields specified ("`Nominal__c,Running__c`") define the columns in the Salesforce object that
  correspond to the CML attributes listed in the table function. Nominal\_\_c maps to `Nominal_Power_Output`, and Running\_\_c maps to `gc_runningKw`.
