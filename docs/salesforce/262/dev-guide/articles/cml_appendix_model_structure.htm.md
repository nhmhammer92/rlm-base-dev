# Model Structure

The tables on the following pages show the structure for the constraint model in Core
Concept Examples.

See [Core Concept Examples](./cml_core_concept_examples.htm.md "These examples illustrate core Constraint Modeling Language (CML) concepts including type, relationships, constraints, and so on.").
