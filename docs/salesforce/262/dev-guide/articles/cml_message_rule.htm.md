# Message Rule

The message rule displays a message to users based on specified conditions.

Message rules have this syntax:

```
message(logical expression, string literal | string variable, argument, .., argument, severity);
message(logical expression, string literal | string variable, severity);
message(logical expression, string literal | string variable);
```

A message rule can take optional arguments to generate the message and indicate the
severity of the message as the last argument. Message severity can be `Info`, `Warning`, or
`Error`. Without an explicit message severity argument,
the message will be treated as `Info`.

Understand the behaviour of each message severity type at runtime.

- The `Info` message type doesn't require the user
  to take any action in order to continue with the current task. Info messages display a
  gray banner.
- The `Warning` message type allows the user to
  continue working on the current task, but blocks them from taking the next step until they
  take action to address the issue described in the message. Warning messages display a
  yellow banner.
- The `Error` message type blocks the user from
  continuing with the current task until they fix the error described in the message. Error
  messages display a red banner. Note: An Error message doesn't block a user working in
  the Transaction Line Editor (Transaction Line Table, or TLT). In that component, the user
  can still make changes and save the quote, even when the quote contains conditions that
  trigger an Error message.

Message format can be a Java string, or a string with {} as a placeholder. The constraint solver replaces each {} with arguments specified after the string, in the order they are written.

## Example

In this example, if `requiredKW` is greater than `2500`, a message is displayed that the specified required kW
is larger than the supported options and must be changed.

```
type GeneratorSet {
int requiredKW = [101..10000];
message(requiredKW > 2500, "The required kW is above what the current options can support. Please adjust to 2500 kW or select a new generator set that meets your requirements.");
}
```
