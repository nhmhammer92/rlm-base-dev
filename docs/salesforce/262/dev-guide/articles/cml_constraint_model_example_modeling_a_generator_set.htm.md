# Modeling a Generator Set

The Constraint Model for a Generator Set examples use CML to define a technical power
configuration, illustrating concepts such as calculated variables, enforcement of external
standards, and component selection based on requirements.

The [examples](./cml_core_concept_examples.htm.md "These examples illustrate core Constraint Modeling Language (CML) concepts including type, relationships, constraints, and so on.") correspond to the [CML core concepts](./cml_cml_core_concepts.htm.md "Constraint Modeling Language (CML) includes components that cover high-level global configurations to specific data types and constraints.") linked here. See the Generator Set
examples for code samples that use the core concepts.

- Global Properties and Settings—`VOLTAGE_REGEX` is a
  global constant that defines a fixed regular expression pattern used for validation or
  parsing throughout the model.
- Types—`GeneratorSet` is the root type that
  represents the main entity. `GeneralModel` represents a
  related component type.
- Variables—The `GeneratorSet` type defines
  variables like `requiredKW` (the user's power
  requirement), `Voltage`, and calculated variables like
  `surgeLoadKW` and `Voltage3` (derived from parsing the `Voltage`
  string).
- Relationships—The `GeneralModels` relation
  connects the `GeneratorSet` type to its possible
  configurations (`GeneralModel`).
- Constraints—Constraints enforce critical business rules and safety standards, such
  as ensuring the selected generator model's power meets the required threshold, or
  restricting configuration options (such as `Voltage`)
  based on the specified compliance standards (`Listing-UL
  2200`).
