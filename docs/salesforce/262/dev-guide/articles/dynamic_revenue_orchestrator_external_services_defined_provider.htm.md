# External Services Defined Provider

Generate interface contract and Apex types by using external services and Open API
compatible schema.

To ‌configure the callout settings for External Services Defined Provider, see [Configuration Steps](./dynamic_revenue_orchestrator_callout_configuration_steps.htm.md "Before you set up a callout provider, configure the callout settings. The settings include the creation of a named credential and an external credential, the creation of an integration definition, and the configuration of a fulfillment step definition.").

​​As an integration specialist user or admin user, perform these steps.

- Set up an external service and actions.
- In the external service definition, include integration parameters such as error codes,
  credentials, and path.

## External Service

Use external services for outbound integrations from Salesforce by using low-code,
process-based integrations to enhance your Apex integrations. See [External Services](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.external_services.htm&type=5&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)").

## Integration Definition Configurations

You can configure these additional features for the integration definition.

- Select the
  **Save
  the request and response as attachments to the record** checkbox for the
  integration definition to save request and response payloads as attachments to the
  Integration Provider Execution record. Content publish limits apply when saving request
  and response payloads as attachments. Use [Shield
  Platform Encryption](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.security_pe_overview.htm&type=5&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)") for secure storage of sensitive information.
- [Define Input and Output Processors
  for the Integration Definition](./dynamic_revenue_orchestrator_input_output_processors.htm.md "HTML (New Window)") for the pre-processing of the standard fulfillment
  request before you send the request to an external system. See [Omnistudio
  Integration Procedures](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.os_omnistudio_integration_procedures_48334.htm&type=5&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)").

See [Create an
Integration Definition](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.consumption_framework_integration_definitions.htm&type=5&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)").

## Step Definition

Set the created integration definition on the Step Definition record with `Callout` as the step type.
