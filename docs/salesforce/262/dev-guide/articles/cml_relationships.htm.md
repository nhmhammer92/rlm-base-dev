# Relationships

Relationships in Constraint Modeling Language (CML) define how different product types
are associated with each other, forming the structural hierarchy of a product bundle.
Relationships are also referred to as ports.

Here’s a comprehensive overview of relationships, their syntax, purpose, and key features,
particularly using examples relevant to the Generator Set model.

## Definition and Syntax of Relationships

Relationships define the one-to-many connections between a parent type (such as a bundle) and its component types (children).

- Keyword: The keyword used is `relation`.
- Syntax: A basic relationship declaration includes the relation name, the target type,
  and cardinality
  bounds.

  ```
  relation <relation name> : <Target Type>[min..max] { /* Optional content */ }
  ```
- Purpose: Relationships represent the product structure in a bundle. For example, the
  root product (GeneratorSet) has relationships with its components (`MainAlternators`, `TemperatureSensors`).

#### Note

Specifying the smallest required cardinality (quantity range) is a best
practice to avoid unnecessary testing of value combinations, which improves
performance.

## Set Maximum Relationship Size

The `maxRelationSize` property is the maximum cardinality for a
single relationship in the constraint model. It controls how many instances of a child
component can exist under one parent through the relationship. The maximum value for
`maxRelationSize` is 1073741824. The default value is
9999.

Use `maxRelationSize` to set a limit based
on the number of instances you need for your business purposes. For example, if the most a
customer can order of a child component is 200,000, set `maxRelationSize` to 200,000. An overly high cardinality limit increases the risk
of unbound variables that cause the constraint engine to backtrack through the entire range
to resolve a conflict. Use `maxRelationSize` with the
`property`.

```
property maxRelationSize = 100000;                                                                  
 type Quote {                                                                             

   relation items : LineItem[0..99999999]; // cardinality uses this max

 }
```

The `maxRelationSize` property doesn’t
limit these values:

- The number of relationship declarations in a type
- The number of types in the constraint model
- The total component count across all relationships

## Omit Unnecessary Relationships

When using the [visual builder](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.product_configurator_use_the_visual_builder.htm&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)") or the [CML editor](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.product_configurator_use_the_cml_editor.htm&language=en_US "HTML (New Window)") to create a CML
code for a bundle, the system by default imports all the relationships for the selected
bundle from the structure defined in Product Catalog Management (PCM). In large and complex
CML code, some of these relationships may not be relevant to any constraint and can be
potentially omitted.

To enable import of a subset of bundle components, add this
property at the top of the constraint model CML
file.

```
property allowMissingRelations = "true";
```

If
your PCM bundle contains many different relations but your CML code defines only one, the
engine will validate the model but this often results in a configuration run-time failure.
By setting `allowMissingRelations = "true"`, you do not
have to define every relation found in the PCM (such as GeneralModels in the Relationship
Ordering example) if they do not require specific configuration logic in your CML
file.

Here’s an example with allowMissingRelations
property.

```
// 1. Enable skipping of unneeded relations from the Product Catalog (PCM)
property allowMissingRelations = "true";

type ConciseGeneratorBundle  {
    // Define only the specific accessory needed for this logic
    relation enclosures : Enclosure;

    // A simple variable to trigger the logic
    int requiredKW = [100..5000];

    // Logic: High power requirements force a specific enclosure type
    // This omits other accessories like filters, batteries, and heaters [2, 3].
    constraint(requiredKW > 2000 -> enclosures[ReinforcedEnclosure] == 1, 
               "Power levels above 2000kW require a Reinforced Enclosure.");
}

// 2. Define the accessory and its specific subtype
type Enclosure ;
type ReinforcedEnclosure : Enclosure;
```

For more information, see [Constraints](./cml_constraints.htm.md "Constraints enforce rules and conditions on types, variables, and relationships. Use constraints to define logical restrictions and ensure consistency within the model.").

To ensure run-time stability
without the allowMissingRelations property, you must manually define every single relation
and type present in the PCM bundle, even if you don't intend to write logic for them. This
creates large CML files with a high number of variables and components, which lead to
performance degradation, and even timeout issues.

#### Note

This code isn’t
recommended.

```
// EXPENSIVE FIX: Mirroring everything
type GeneratorSet {
    relation engineModels : EngineModel; // Unused in CML logic
    relation alternators : Alternator;    // Unused in CML logic
    relation fuelFilters : FuelFilter;    // Unused in CML logic
    relation starterMotors : StarterMotor; // Unused in CML logic
    relation enclosures : Enclosure;      // The only one we need
    // ... potentially 15+ more relations ...

    constraint(requiredKW > 2000 -> enclosures[ReinforcedEnclosure] == 1);
}
type Enclosure ;
type ReinforcedEnclosure : Enclosure;
```

## Order Keyword

The `order()` keyword is used within a `relation` declaration to define the specific sequence in which
the constraint engine evaluates and attempts to instantiate the child subtypes available in
that relationship. This controls the prioritization of component selection.

## Example: Relationship Ordering

```
// --- Component Subtypes (Specific Generator Models) ---
// Define a base type for generator models with a power attribute
type GeneralModel {
int powerKW = [0..3000]; // Explicit domain
}
// Specific subtypes that inherit from GeneralModel
type GeneralModel2500 : GeneralModel {
int powerKW = 2500;
}
type GeneralModel1750 : GeneralModel {
int powerKW = 1750;
}
type GeneralModel900 : GeneralModel {
int powerKW = 900;
}
// --- Parent Type (GeneratorSet) ---
type GeneratorSet {
// Required power defined by the parent (non-configurable)
@(configurable = false)
int requiredKW = [100..3000];
// Relation Declaration using order()
// Cardinality requires exactly one model to be selected.
// order() sets the selection priority (2500 KW model is checked before 1750 KW model).
relation GeneralModels : GeneralModel  order(GeneralModel2500, GeneralModel1750, GeneralModel900);
}
```

- **[Relationship Variable Functions](./cml_relationship_variable_functions.htm.md)**  
  CML variable functions are fundamental tools used to perform both aggregation (summarizing data from related components) and complex mathematical calculations on attribute values (variables) within a configuration model. These functions are crucial for enforcing dimensional validity and calculating derived attributes.
- **[Relationship Annotations](./cml_relationship_annotations.htm.md)**  
  You can annotate relationships by using annotations, such as configurable, allowNewInstance, closeRelation, sourceContextNode, and so on.
