# TaxEngineAdapter Interface

Retrieves and evaluates the details from a tax engine to define tax
details.

You can extend the TaxEngineAdapter interface to define a custom tax adapter based on
your requirements. Use the custom tax adapter with Billing services to implement
standard tax.

Create a custom object and associated fields to store tax details, such as tax rate for a
country. For example, create a custom object named CountryTaxRate with Country\_Code and
Tax\_Rate fields. Create records to define the details for these fields.
