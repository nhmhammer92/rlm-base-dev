This table provides the deployment sequence, object types, API names, lookup fields,
and data translation requirements for Salesforce Pricing objects in Revenue Cloud.

![Important](/docs/resources/img/en-us/262.0?doc_id=images%2Ficon_note_important.png&folder=revenue_lifecycle_management_dev_guide)

#### Important

Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company
value of Equality. We maintained certain terms to avoid any effect on customer
implementations.
