# BillingSettings

Represents the settings for Salesforce
Billing.

## Parent Type and Manifest Access

This type extends the [Metadata](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.api_meta.meta/api_meta/metadata.htm "HTML (New Window)") metadata type and inherits its fullName
field.

In the package manifest, all the settings metadata types for the org are accessed using the
“Settings” name. See [Settings](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_settings.htm "HTML (New Window)") for more details.

## File Suffix and Directory Location

The BillingSettings values are stored in the
BillingSettings.settings file in the
settings folder. The .settings files
are different from other named components, because there’s only one settings file
for each settings component.

## Version

BillingSettings components are available in API version 62.0 and later.

## Special Access Rules

These settings are available when Billing is enabled.

## Wildcard Support in the Manifest File

The wildcard character `*` (asterisk) in the
package.xml manifest file doesn’t apply to metadata types
for feature settings. The wildcard applies only when retrieving all settings, not
for an individual setting. For details, see [Settings](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_settings.htm "HTML (New Window)"). For information about using the manifest file, see [Deploying and Retrieving Metadata with the Zip File](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.262.0.api_meta.meta/api_meta/file_based_zip_file.htm "HTML (New Window)").
