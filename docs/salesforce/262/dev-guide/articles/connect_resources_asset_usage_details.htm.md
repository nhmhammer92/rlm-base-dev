# Asset Usage Details (GET)

Get details of a usage-based product associated with an asset. This
covers details of grants, resources, and configured rates for the product, including
negotiated rates in case of a rate override.

Here are the details that this API returns.

- Grants and resources for the product, if rates aren’t configured.
- Grants, resources, and any configured rates for the product. The rates are returned by
  the [Rate Plan (GET) API](./connect_resources_get_rate_plan.htm.md "HTML (New Window)").

  in case of a rate override request.
