# Types

In Constraint Modeling Language (CML), you define types to represent entities or
objects in the model. Types are the foundational building blocks of CML. A type encapsulates the
property, relationships, constraint, and rules for the entity.

A type is similar to a class in object-oriented programming. You can define relationships
that represent associations between different types. See [Relationships](./cml_relationships.htm.md "Relationships in Constraint Modeling Language (CML) define how different product types are associated with each other, forming the structural hierarchy of a product bundle. Relationships are also referred to as ports.").

#### Note

To define a constraint for a child product in a
bundle, you must include the entire bundle in the constraint model. For example, if you
define a constraint for a laptop, and the laptop is a child product in the Laptop Pro
Bundle, you must include the Laptop Pro Bundle in the constraint model for the constraint on
the laptop to run.

#### Note

Product variants aren't supported in constraint models.

## Generic Structure of a Type

This table explains the generic structure of types with examples.

| Element | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Declaration | Defines the entity name, optionally preceded by annotations and optionally followed by inheritance, if applicable. | `type Product {}` ``` Or optionally: @annotation_name("annotation parameters") type Product: BaseProduct {} ``` |
| Variables (Attributes) | Defines the properties or characteristics of the entity, including data type and domain. | ``` int requiredKW = [101..10000]; string color = ["Red", "Blue"]; ``` |
| Relations | Defines one-to-many associations with other types, specifying cardinality (the quantity range) and optionally, the configuration order. | ``` relation items : LineItem[1..10] {} ``` |
| Constraints and Rules | Enforces business logic and restrictions that must be satisfied by the entity's variables and relationships. | ``` constraint(condition); require(condition, items [type]); ``` |

## Example: Basic Type Declaration with Variables

This example shows the declaration of the main `GeneratorSet` type. It defines several core attributes (variables) that
characterize the product.

```
type GeneratorSet{
// Declaration only (inherits LineItem properties)
// Attributes with explicit domains
int requiredKW = [101..10000];
string Voltage = ["220/380", "240/416", "255/440", "277/480", "347/600", "2400/4160", "7200/12470", "7621/13200", "7976/13800];
string DutyRating = ["Prime Power (PRP)", "Continuous Power (COP)", "Data Center Continuous (DCC)", "Emergency Standby Power (ESP)"];
}
```

- **[Type Hierarchies](./cml_type_hierarchies.htm.md)**  
  Constraint Modeling Language (CML) supports inheritance and overriding, which allow you to create hierarchies between types. By establishing these hierarchies, constraint models become more modular and efficient.
- **[Type Annotations](./cml_type_annotations.htm.md)**  
  You can annotate types to add information. Type annotations are metadata applied to a type declaration to provide instructions to the constraint engine regarding how instances of that type should be handled, instantiated, or used in the configuration structure.
- **[Group Type](./cml_group_type.htm.md)**  
  In Constraint Modeling Language (CML), a Group Type is used to logically containerize related components within a bundle configuration, primarily when product component groups are imported from Product Catalog Management (PCM).
