Before you send invoice PDF documents from Invoice records, you and your Billing Admin must define the invoice email delivery configuration and preferences.

From the App Launcher, find and select Invoices.
Open the Invoice record that you want to send an email for.
Go to the Invoice Documents related list.
From the quick actions menu on the Invoice Document row that you want to send an email for, click Email Invoice.
When you click Email Invoice, the system doesn't consider email opt-out preference selected on the related Bill to Contact record.

When you click Email Invoice, the system first looks for email preferences in this sequence. An email, with the invoice PDF document attached, is then sent to the email address of the bill to contact of the invoice. The email body has the invoice ID, the balance amount, and the invoice due date.

If the invoice email is delivered, then a success message appears immediately on the record. If the invoice email delivery fails due to these reasons, an error message appears on the Invoice record.

Exceeded the daily email limit.
Missing email address on the invoice's Bill to Contact record.
Presence of merge fields other than the invoice merge fields on the customized email template.

You can also track the emails in the activity timeline on the Invoice record's Details page.
