Usage of Legal Entities

After automatic population of legal entity on billing transactions, the legal entity is used in these scenarios.

Legal Entity Based Tax Treatment: When you choose legal entity as the treatment selection during tax policy creation, the system selects the tax treatment based on the legal entity and populates it on the order product or quote line item. This tax treatment is then used for the tax calculation. See Create Tax Policies and Treatments.
Invoice Grouping: When the invoice grouping type on the billing schedule is set to default or custom, the system uses the billing schedule group's legal entity along with other fields that make a default group to consolidate invoice records. See Define Invoice Grouping on a Billing Schedule.
Settle invoice lines based on legal entity: During the credit application process, the system validates the invoice line and credit memo line for a matching legal entity. The system applies the credit memo line to an invoice line only if it finds a matching legal entity on the invoice line. See Create and Apply Credit Memos to Invoice Lines.
Financial Accounting Usage:
Automatic Population of Legal Entity Accounting Period: When legal entity of a billing transaction is autopopulated, its legal entity accounting period is also automatically populated. See Assign Legal Entities to Accounting Periods
Transaction Journal creation: During transaction journal creation for the general ledger account assignment rule, the system validates if the transaction type's legal entity matches the general ledger account assignment rule's legal entity. See General Ledger Account Assignment Rules and Related Records.
Legal Entity Accounting Period (LEAP) Closure: During legal entity accounting period closure, the system validates billing transaction records that match the legal entity accounting period's legal entity and are within the start and end dates of its accounting period. See Close Legal Entity Accounting Periods.
Considerations for Editing Legal Entity on Billing Transactions

Review these considerations before you edit the Legal Entity field on billing transactions.

The Legal Entity field on billing transactions is editable regardless of the billing transaction's status.
When you edit the legal entity of a billing transaction, update the legal entity accounting period of the billing transaction manually. See Assign Legal Entities to Accounting Periods.
The legal entity is automatically populated only when a Billing Transaction record is created. When the Legal Entity field is updated on a billing transaction, the Legal Entity field on its related records must be manually updated.
If you edit the Legal Entity field on billing transaction records for which transaction journals are created, then:
Manually update the Legal Entity field on the transaction journals created for the general ledger accounting assignment rule.
Manually update the existing foreign exchange realized gain and loss transaction journals that are created for the Payment Line Invoice, Payment Line Invoice Line, and Credit Memo Line Invoice Line records.
Reopen and close Legal Entity Accounting Period record to update the legal entity field for the foreign exchange unrealized gain and loss transaction journals.
