# Results of Credit Memo Application

After posted invoices are generated, credits are applied based on the credit application level.

REQUIRED EDITIONS
Available in: Lightning Experience
Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Revenue Cloud Advanced license or the Revenue Cloud Billing license

Applying a credit memo or credit memo line reduces the balance of an invoice or an invoice line. For example, applying a $100 credit memo line to a $500 invoice line reduces the invoice line’s balance to $400.

After the credits are applied, the balance amounts and applied credit amounts are automatically updated as shown in this table.
