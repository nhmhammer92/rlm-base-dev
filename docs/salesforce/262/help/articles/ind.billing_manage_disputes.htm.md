# Manage Billing Disputes

Fragmented billing dispute processes often lead to payment delays and poor customer experience. By using the dispute management feature, you can streamline the intake and resolution process for common billing requests and disputes. Install pre-built service process templates by using Unified Catalog. Your billing specialists and customer service representatives can initiate cases directly from the Account record page, and quickly capture, validate, and resolve common inquiries, all from a single catalog. Billing portal users can raise service requests through the self-service Billing portal.

REQUIRED EDITIONS
Available in: Lightning Experience
Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Revenue Cloud Billing license. Contact your Salesforce account executive for more information.
Key Features

Enable your service reps to initiate and complete service requests directly on behalf of your customers.

They can also view metrics for open billing cases and disputes on the Billing Operations Console homepage.
Billing Dispute Management Workflow

The dispute management feature provides an end-to-end process for handling billing inquiries and disputes through three interconnected workflows. From initial setup to final resolution, these workflows help you streamline dispute handling, reduce manual intervention, and provide transparent self-service capabilities for your customers. The dispute management lifecycle consists of three phases.

Initial Setup: Set up dispute management feature to assign permissions, object and field accesses, add community users, configure the self-service Billing portal, and install the service process templates. This one-time setup establishes the foundation for automated capture and processing of service requests raised by your community users.
Service Request Submission: The billing portal or community users initiate billing inquiries or raise invoice-related disputes by using the self-service portal. For every service request that’s submitted, billing automatically creates a case or dispute record that your billing specialist or customer service representative can review and resolve. Starting Summer ‘26, your service reps can also submit service requests and raise cases on behalf of the customer, directly using the Billing app. Depending on
Service Request Resolution: Your customer service representatives and billing specialists resolve the service requests directly from the case records. Depending on the type of service process request, Billing automatically runs the appropriate billing resolution whether it’s extending the invoice due date, updating the billing contact, suspending billing, or issuing credit memos.
Service Process Templates

The dispute management setup installs Unified Catalog templates for common billing inquiry and dispute scenarios. Each template corresponds to a type of service process request. The template includes an Omniscripts intake form, an email template to notify the customer upon successful case submission, and a predefined Resolve Case action on the case record. For example, when you install the Suspend Billing template, a service process with the same name is created, that you can then add to a catalog in Unified Catalog.

Suspend Billing: Temporarily pause or resume billing for services or subscriptions.
Update Bill To Contact on Invoice: Change billing contact for specific invoices with an optional default setting.
Extend Invoice Due Date: Extend the due date on a selected invoice.
Incorrect Invoice Charge: Report and correct incorrect charges on invoice or invoice lines.
Other Billing Inquiries: Raise any general billing inquiries or disputes that don’t have predefined service process templates.
Help Center and Cases Tabs on the Self-Service Billing Portal

The self-service billing portal is a dedicated portal that helps your customers log billing inquiries and disputes. They can use the Help Center and Cases tabs to raise case requests and track case status.

Help Center tab: This tab shows the billing service catalog with available service processes to raise requests. Your community users can navigate this tab to identify and run the service processes they need. The tab shows available service requests for suspending billing, updating bill-to contact, extending invoice due date, raising invoice charge disputes, and other billing inquiries.
Cases tab: Helps your community users monitor their case details, updates, and resolution information. Your customers can also track all active and historical billing inquiries.
Raise Service Requests on Behalf of the Customer
Initiate billing disputes or inquiries on behalf of your customer directly from the Billing app.
Resolve Billing Service Requests
When customers or service reps raise billing service requests or inquiries , Billing creates corresponding cases that are resolved by using the automated resolution actions. For specific service requests such as suspending billing, extending invoice due date, updating billing contact details, or correcting invoice charges, Billing automatically initiates the appropriate resolution associated with the service request. However, for any other billing inquiries that don’t have automated resolution, resolve the cases manually based on the business need and requirements.
