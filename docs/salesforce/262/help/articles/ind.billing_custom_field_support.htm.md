# Capture Preferred Transaction Details by Using Custom Fields

To meet specific business requirements, populate custom field data from orders or external transactions to corresponding billing schedule, billing schedule group, and billing schedule group relationship records. Use Context Service to define how data must be transferred by configuring a custom intracontext mapping. Then, use the Create Billing Schedules for Orders API or the Create Standalone Billing Schedules API to generate billing schedules and billing schedule groups. You can also use custom fields to override the standard fields in billing nodes by using the custom intracontext mapping.

REQUIRED EDITIONS
Available in: Lightning Experience
Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Revenue Cloud Advanced license or the Revenue Cloud Billing license
USER PERMISSIONS

For example, you can create and map a custom field Purchase Order Number on an order object to a field named Purchase Order Number on the corresponding billing schedule object. Similarly, you can define and map a custom field Purchase Order Date on an order item to a Purchase Order Date field on the corresponding billing schedule group object.

In Context Service, add the corresponding attributes and tag names to the extended context definitions.
Pass any preferred transaction data from orders to billing schedules by using the extended BillingContext context definition.

To capture preferred details from orders, edit the OrderEntities context mapping to map custom fields from the billing transaction context node attributes to the order fields.
To capture preferred details from any external transactions, edit the TransactionMapping context mapping to map the Transaction node attributes with external transaction fields.
