# About Debit Memos

A debit memo is issued by a seller to a buyer when the seller wants to levy additional charges to what was already billed or charged. For example, late payment fees, cancellation fees, and so on.

Debit Memo Scenarios

Debit memos are issued in scenarios where a seller must charge an additional amount that a buyer owes. These situations often arise because of:

Billing Errors: If a seller undercharges a customer, then a debit memo is issued to adjust the charge and collect the payment.
Cancellation or Suspension of Services: If services are canceled before they're completely delivered or a recurring subscription is suspended, then a debit memo is issued to bill the cancellation charges or suspension fee.
Late Payment Charges: If a customer misses to pay the outstanding invoice amounts, then a debit memo is issued to charge a late payment fee.
Business Use Case: Issuing a Debit Memo for an Undercharged Invoice

A service provider, Acme Software Innovations Inc., provides a monthly subscription of their analytics platform to their customer, Growth Digital Marketing Pro, for a standard fee of US$500. Because of a data entry error, the invoice for the current month was accidentally generated for only $400, resulting in an undercharge of $100.

In this scenario, Acme Software Innovations Inc. would issue a debit memo to Growth Digital Marketing Pro to correct the undercharge. The debit memo would be for the missing $100, with a single debit memo line for Analytics Platform License adjustment.

For Acme Software Innovations Inc. (Seller), the accounting impact of this transaction is twofold.

Their accounts receivable increases by $100, as they now expect to collect the additional amount.
Their revenue also increases by $100, correcting the previously under recognized revenue for the service provided.

This debit memo makes sure that Acme Software Innovations Inc. have accurate financial records reflecting the true value of the transaction, which maintains transparency and proper financial reconciliation.
