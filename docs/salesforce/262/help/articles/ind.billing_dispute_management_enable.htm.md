On the account’s contact related list, view or add the contact record for the user that you want to add to a site. When you create a customer user, Salesforce creates a user record in your org with some details pre-populated from the contact record.

Install the service process templates by using Unified Catalog.
From the App Launcher, find and select Unified Catalog.

Add the service processes to the catalog and save your changes. Note the catalog ID as you need it to configure the Help Center page in Experience Builder.

We recommend that you clone the out-of-the-box Resolve Service Request screen flow. In the cloned screen flow, you can modify the invoice charge correction resolution screen to make the Approved Amount column editable. This configuration helps your customer service reps directly update approved amounts on disputed invoice lines when they resolve invoice charge disputes.

Your dispute management setup is complete. Your billing portal or community user can now raise billing inquiries and disputes that can be resolved by your customer service representatives.

NOTE To resolve any Omniscripts component issues in the Help Center, we recommend that you set the field-level security for Content and Sequence fields of the Omni Process Compilation object.
