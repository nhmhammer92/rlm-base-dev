# Assign Permissions to Access Billing Features

Assign your users the required permission sets based on their persona, and for the APIs for which they need access.

REQUIRED EDITIONS
Available in: Lightning Experience
Available in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with Agentforce Revenue Management


The Billing Collections and Recovery Specialist permission set, the Payment Admin permission set, and the Payment Operations User permission set are available only with the the Agentforce Revenue Management Billing license. Contact your Salesforce account executive for more information.

All the other permission sets are available with the Agentforce Revenue Management Advanced license or the Agentforce Revenue Management Billing license.

Create Users and Profiles

To begin, create users for Billing in Agentforce Revenue Management. Then assign users the appropriate permission sets. To help you plan, use the permission set table for Billing. When you create a user, you must also assign a profile to define the default settings for users. Some organizations create their own profiles, while others choose to use profiles included with Salesforce.

Remember, users can have only one profile, but can have many permission sets assigned to them.

Billing Permission Sets by Persona

Billing is managed by users who have different roles and expertise. The permission sets based on personas combine specific permissions that outline each user's responsibilities. All these permission sets are part of the Billing User permission set license. The Billing Customer Service User permission set is included in both Billing and Billing Advanced permission set licenses.
