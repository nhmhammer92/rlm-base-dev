# Process Payments and Issue Refunds by Using APIs

Use a suite of APIs to process payments and issue refunds. Authorize and capture payments by using native payment gateways, reverse payment authorizations, tokenize payment methods, and save card details for processing recurring payments. Create and update payment schedulers, and allocate or unallocate payments. You can also process ad hoc payments, and refund your customers if they change or cancel products or services that they paid for.

REQUIRED EDITIONS
Available in: Lightning Experience
Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with Revenue Cloud
The Salesforce Payments feature is available with the Revenue Cloud Billing license, with a cost per transaction model for both native and Bring Your Own payment gateways. Contact your Salesforce account executive for more information.
If you purchased the Revenue Cloud Billing license on or before July 2025, contact your Salesforce account executive to add the Salesforce Payments feature to your existing license.
