# :quantumbit: FY27 Revenue Cloud QuantumBit Script — Summer '26 (Release 262)

> **Generated:** 2026-05-24 by `.cursor/skills/qb-demo-script/SKILL.md`
> **Source canvas (260):** [F09Q04HEC8Y](https://salesforce.enterprise.slack.com/docs/T45GK97GB/F09Q04HEC8Y)
> **Salesforce Release:** 262 (Summer '26) · API v67.0
> **Status:** DRAFT — preview release, not yet GA. Requires SME pass for Setup-UI verification, Known-Bugs population, image capture, and Slack canvas publish.
> **Grounded on:**

> - `.agents/artifacts/qb-canvas-260-source.md` (prior-release Slack canvas — source of the 6 persona names + bios; personas are stable release-to-release and **not yet** in `qb-scenario-reference.md` — migration tracked separately so future regenerations don't depend on the local-only canvas source)
> - `docs/salesforce/262/feature-index.md` (262 feature inventory)
> - `docs/salesforce/262/help/articles/` (935-article Help portal mirror)

Recommended: capture screenshots against a 262 demo org spun up via `cci flow run prepare_rlm_org --org beta` with full feature flags, upload via Slack file upload API, substitute the markers via search-replace.
