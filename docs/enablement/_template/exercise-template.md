## Authoring Notes (delete before publishing)

- Use **QuantumBit catalog** product names and SKUs in all data references. Look them up in `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm/Product2.csv`.
- For pricing-specific data (price books, adjustment schedules), use names from `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pricing/`.
- Screenshots: capture against an org provisioned by `cci flow run prepare_rlm_org` so visuals match user environment.
- New features that depend on org setup not in `prepare_rlm_org` should call out the prerequisite explicitly at the top of the feature section.
- "Carry-forward features" list keeps each release exercise scoped to net-new content. Readers reference prior-release exercise PDFs in the historical archive (`docs/enablement/258/` and earlier) for stable features.
