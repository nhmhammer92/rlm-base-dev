# Revenue Cloud Enablement — Coverage Matrix

Working document tracking what enablement artifacts exist across releases, what's missing, and what needs to be created or updated.

**Version mapping** (RCA package versions → seasonal release):

| Folder | Package | Release | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `248/` *(label only)* | 248 | Spring '24 | Reference only — oldest, sparse |
| (none) | 250 | Summer '24 | Missing entirely |
| `252/` *(label only)* | 252 | Winter '25 | Exercises only (PDF) |
| `254/` *(label only)* | 254 | Spring '25 | Exercises only (PDF) |
| `256/` *(label only)* | 256 | Summer '25 | Exercises only (PDF) |
| `258/` *(label only)* | 258 | Winter '26 | Exercise drafts (some incomplete, PDF) |
| `260/` | 260 | Spring '26 | **Prior GA** — 10 per-release `.md` drafts complete |
| `262/` | 262 | Summer '26 | **Current development cycle** — feature index + Help snapshot (935 articles) landed; QB demo script drafted; per-area Hands-On extracts pending master sign-off |

> *Label only* = the **`248/`–`258/`** values appear in carry-forward citations across the catalog as non-clickable identifiers for external PDFs that live outside git (see `docs/enablement/README.md` § *Directory map*). They are **not** directories in this checkout. `260/` and `262/` exist as real per-release directories.

Most "Overview" links in the journey map point out to Salesforce Help; we author **Hands-On Exercises only**.

### Per-release SE/partner artifacts (non-extract)

In addition to the per-area Hands-On extracts tracked above, `docs/enablement/{version}/` also hosts SE/partner artifacts that are **not** filtered views of master — they have their own authoring SKILL and are released as standalone deliverables.

| File | Release | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`262/qb-demo-script.md`](262/qb-demo-script.md) | 262 | 🚧 Draft (preview release) | Generated 2026-05-24 via [`.cursor/skills/qb-demo-script/SKILL.md`](../../.cursor/skills/qb-demo-script/SKILL.md); pending SME pass for Setup-UI verification, Known-Bugs population, image capture, Slack canvas publish |

### Notes on draft state of 258 PDFs

All 258 files are titled "Enablement Exercises, Version 1.0, Winter '26" — confirmed exercise content (not overview decks) despite the "External" filename suffix.

Several have **placeholder headers** (`Salesforce Feature Name` instead of the actual feature name) — these are drafts that were never finalized:

- Context Service (22pp)
- Invoice Management (23pp)

The rest carry proper headers but should still be reviewed for completeness.

## Data Shape Evolution Across Releases

The example data used in exercises has changed across releases. This affects how much can be ported vs. needs rewriting.

| Release | Example company / data | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 248 (Sp'24) | "Acme" + Android/iOS phones | Generic, pre-RCA naming ("RLM" prefix on filenames) |
| 252 (W'25) | "Laptop Pro Bundle" + various | Different from 248 |
| 254 (Sp'25) | (no clear company tag found in PCM) | Mixed |
| 256 (Su'25) | **"QuantumBit (SmartBytes company)"** | First clear use of QB |
| 258 (W'26) | Generic Setup-driven instructions | Few specific data references |

The current `rlm-base-dev` data plan (`datasets/sfdmu/qb/`) builds the **QuantumBit** catalog — 162 products across 28 PCM objects, with structured attributes, classifications, and bundles. This is the org shape that any new Winter '26 (or later) exercises should align to.

The older `scratch_data` plan still exists in the repo but is the legacy shape (Accounts like "Global Media", "Infinitech").

---

## Filename Normalization Recommendation

Current naming is inconsistent:

- `248 RLM Pricing Hands-on Exercises.pdf`
- `Winter '25 - Pricing Exercises.pdf`
- `Spring '25 Pricing Hands On Exercises.pdf`
- `Summer '25 - Salesforce Pricing.pdf`
- `Salesforce Pricing - Winter '26 Revenue Cloud - External.pdf`

Proposed convention going forward:

```
{version} - {area} - Hands-On.pdf      # exercises
{version} - {area} - Overview.pdf      # if/when overview decks are authored
```

Example: `258 - Salesforce Pricing - Hands-On.pdf`

Sorts cleanly by version, area is unambiguous, type suffix lets both kinds coexist.

## Open Questions for Author

1. **Scope of org/data change** — Is the work to:
   - (a) migrate exercises that still reference older data shapes (Acme, Laptop Pro) onto the QuantumBit catalog?
   - (b) update QuantumBit-aligned exercises to reflect changes within QB itself (new products, restructured bundles, renamed fields)?
   - (c) both?
2. ~~**Target release** — Is Winter '26 (258) the deliverable…~~ — **Resolved 2026-05-22.** 262 (Summer '26) is the current development cycle; 260 (Spring '26) is the prior GA reference. Master exercises target 262; 260 per-release extracts remain in the catalog as the prior-release authoring output.
3. **Advanced Approvals** for 258 — needs to be authored from scratch? The journey map includes it, but no draft exists in the 258 folder. (Lower priority now that 260 has a `.md` draft.)
4. **Recordings** — Winter '26 page in the journey map omits the "Recording" links every prior release had. Intentional (no recordings this cycle), or TODO?
