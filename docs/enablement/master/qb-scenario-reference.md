# QuantumBit Scenario Reference

The canonical reference for what a `prepare_rlm_org`-built QuantumBit org contains by default. This document grounds every master exercise — when an exercise needs to reference a product, account, legal entity, bundle, constraint model, etc., the source of truth is here, traced back to the data plan that provisions it.

> **Status:** Living document. Update when QB data plans add or remove records, or when new constraint models, customer templates, or partners are added.
> **Last Updated:** 2026-05-06
> **Source orgs:** Built via `cci flow run prepare_rlm_org` with default flag set (`qb=true`, `billing=true`, `tax=true`, `dro=true`, `rating=true`, `rates=true`, `clm=true`, `prm=true`, `docgen=true`, `constraints=true`, `constraints_data=true`).

### Pricing-feature mapping onto QB bundles

The standing pricing data wires each Salesforce Pricing **adjustment type** to specific products inside `QB-COMPLETE`:

| Pricing Feature | Records | Wired to | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bundle-Based Adjustment** | 2 | `QB-API` (Term Annual) inside `QB-COMPLETE` | 5% Percentage discount when QB-API is sold as part of QB-COMPLETE root bundle |
| **Attribute-Based Adjustment** | 4 | `QB-API` with `ATTR-QB-API` environment attribute (Term Annual) | Override-type prices: **Flex = $10,000 · Pre-Prod = $12,000 · Prod = $15,000 · Gov = $8,500** |
| **Volume Adjustment (PriceAdjustmentTier)** | 3 | `QB-MSG-STRT` (Additional Messages QB Starter, Term Annual) | Tiered Percentage discount: **5–10 units → 10% off · 11–15 → 15% off · 16+ → 25% off** |
| **Derived Pricing** | 2 (PricebookEntryDerivedPrice) | Configured for sub-bundle relationships | Products derive prices from contributing products in the bundle |

**For workshop authoring:** when demonstrating Salesforce Pricing features, anchor walkthroughs on these specific products.

> **Gap to flag for Spring '26 Pricing exercise:** Price Propagation (the 260 ascending/horizontal propagation feature) does NOT have pre-configured propagation rules. The structural prerequisite (nested component groups) exists in `QB-QRack-750` (Computing → Cooling, Storage → Hard Drives, PCIe → GPUs/I/O/Networking), but the propagation table itself isn't built. Workshop walkthroughs need to *configure* the propagation table during the exercise — actually a strength for in-person teaching.

## 4. Multi-Currency

7 active currencies:

| ISO Code | Units per 1 USD | Decimal Places | Corporate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **USD** | 1 | 2 | ✅ Yes |
| EUR | 0.876364 | 2 |  |
| GBP | 0.74772 | 2 |  |
| CAD | 1.408989 | 2 |  |
| AUD | 1.430143 | 2 |  |
| CHF | 0.813755 | 2 |  |
| JPY | 163.08664 | 0 |  |

Direction matters: these are **foreign units per 1 USD**, and the generators
*multiply* a USD amount by them — USD 10,000 → EUR 8,763.64. Reading the column as
"conversion **to** USD" inverts every future rate.

## 6. Usage Management

### Usage Resources (4)

| Code | Name | UoM Class | Billing Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QB-TOKEN` | Quantum Tokens | Token UoM Class | monthlytotal |
| `UR-CPUTIME` | Compute Time | TIME (minutes) | monthlytotal |
| `UR-DATASTORAGE` | Data Storage | DATAVOL (TB) | monthlypeak |
| `UR-DATAXFR` | Data Throughput | DATAVOL (GB) | monthlytotal |

**Plus a sub-resource:** `UR-DATASTORAGE-TKN` and `UR-CPUTIME-TKN` (token-rated variants tied to `QB-TOKEN`)

### Usage-Rated Products (10)

| SKU | Description |
|---|---|
| `QB-DB` | QuantumBit Database (CPU time + Data Storage multi-resource) |
| `QB-DB-TOKEN` | QuantumBit Database (Token-rated variant) |
| `QB-DAT-THPT` | Data Throughput product |
| `QB-TOKENS-PACK` | Token Pack (consumption tokens) |
| `QB-CMT-TKN-EACH` | Commitment Tokens (per-token rated) |
| `QB-CMT-TKN-FLAT` | Commitment Tokens (flat-rate) |
| `QB-CMT-TKN-TIER` | Commitment Tokens (tiered) |
| `QB-CMT-TKN-BND` | Commitment Tokens (bounded — discount stops at the committed amount) |
| `QB-MTY-CMT` | Monetary Commitment |
| `QB-QTY-CMT` | Quantity Commitment |

**8 of the 10 participate in the QB-COMPLETE bundle's `QB-PCG-USAGE` component group.**
`QB-DAT-THPT` and `QB-TOKENS-PACK` are deliberately **not** bundle components — they are
target-bound top-ups (`GrantBindingType = Target`) sold against an anchor asset, and a pack
cannot be sold standalone. Verify with:

```bash
awk -F, 'NR>1 && $0 ~ /QB-PCG-USAGE/' datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm/ProductRelatedComponent.csv | wc -l

## 7. CML Constraint Models (4 imported, 2 active)

`prepare_constraints` imports four CML constraint models and activates two against the QB catalog — **Server2** (hardware) and **QuantumBitBundle** (software). Only one QuantumBit *software* model can be active at a time, so **QuantumBitComplete** and **QuantumBitPCM** are imported but left **inactive** for A/B/C comparison. See `datasets/constraints/README.md` → "QuantumBitBundle (combined model)".

### QuantumBitBundle (61 ESC records = 33 Type + 28 Port, 33 products) — ACTIVE software model

A LineItem-primary union of QuantumBitComplete's configurable bundle and QuantumBitPCM's virtual-quote cart-level rules. It **preserves QuantumBitComplete's full bundle behavior** (same ports / attributes / constraints — see Type/Port semantics below) and **adds** PCM's cart-level `require` / `recommend` cross-item rules (require QuantumBit Database with API Access Requests; recommend Essentials / Fundamentals Training). Targeted products = the QuantumBitComplete set (below) plus Gold Hardware Maintenance, QuantumBit Collaboration Suite, Additional API Flex (100M), and Additional API Gov.

### QuantumBitComplete (57 ESC records = 29 Type + 28 Port, 29 products) — imported, INACTIVE

Software-focused constraints; the bundle/configuration source grafted into QuantumBitBundle. Targeted products include:
- Additional API, API Access Requests (AEH), Additional Automation QB Credits
- QuantumBit Services Project, QuantumBit Database (8 variants: base, token-based, token-commit each/flat/tier/bounded, monetary commit, quantity commit)
- Professional Services Daily Rate, Professional Services Scope of Work, Software Maintenance
- API Management Solution, Additional Flows/Messages

### QuantumBitPCM (12 ESC records = 12 Type, 0 Port) — imported, INACTIVE

Virtual-quote (v67) cross-item source grafted into QuantumBitBundle: an `@(virtual="true") Quote` container with cart-level `require` / `recommend` rules and **no** bundle ports (its product relationships are expressed in CML via context-bound relations, not `ProductRelatedComponent`).

### Server2 (81 ESC records = 41 Type + 40 Port, 41 products) — ACTIVE, wired to QB-QRack-750

Hardware-focused constraints. Targeted products include:
- HDD: 1TB / 4TB / 8TB / 20TB NLSAS variants, 1TB / 3TB 10k RPM
- Memory: 8GB / 16GB / 32GB / 64GB / 128GB RDIMM
- CPU: Intel Xeon Gold 5318N / 6330N / 6354 + Plat 22Ghz/23Ghz/24Ghz variants
- Cooling: QB CPU Heat Sink, QB-CacheBoost 150, AirCooler / LiquidCooler
- Power: QBPowerCore (500S/800S/1600S) + QBPowerSafe (600D/1000D/2000D)
- Networking: Link 10G/25G/100G, Secure 10G
- Storage SSDs: SSD2/4/8/16/30
- Acceleration: Accel, NVExpand, Nova
- RAID: RAID500

**Constraint structure — Type vs Port semantics:**

ESC records use two `ConstraintModelTagType` values that drive how the Constraint Builder evaluates configurations:

| Tag Type | QuantumBitBundle | QuantumBitComplete | Server2 | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Type** | 33 | 29 | 41 | Identifies a *kind* of product (e.g., `QuantumBitDatabase`, `Gold_22Ghz_28C56T`, `RAM64`) |
| **Port** | 28 | 28 | 40 | Identifies a *socket* into which a Type plugs (e.g., `quantumbitdatabase`, `gold22ghz`, `ram64`) |

(QuantumBitBundle's 28 Ports are inherited verbatim from QuantumBitComplete's bundle; its 33 Types = QuantumBitComplete's 29 plus 4 PCM-unique products. QuantumBitPCM contributes 12 Type tags and 0 Ports.)

**Port-type semantics in plain terms:** the Constraint Builder treats Ports as connection points. A Type tag identifies what kind of component a product is; a Port tag identifies the slot it fills. The constraint logic in the CML blob — plain text, not a compiled binary — enforces compatibility — e.g., a `gold22ghz` CPU port can only accept Type tags compatible with that CPU socket; a `ram64` port only accepts 64GB RAM Type tags.

This is the model that powers the Spring '26 Configurator features (Compact Layout, Sticky Errors, Inline Attribute Configuration, Enhanced Instance Selection) — they all run against the constraint engine that interprets these Type/Port relationships.

**The two active models** are activated automatically by `prepare_constraints` Phase 2 when `constraints_data=true` (default). Activation sets `Server2_V1` and `QuantumBitBundle_V1` ExpressionSetVersions to `Active`. `QuantumBitComplete_V1` and `QuantumBitPCM_V1` are imported but left `Inactive` (only one QuantumBit software model can be active at a time).

## 11. Dynamic Revenue Orchestration (DRO)

`qb-dro` provisions a single-pass plan with 14 design-time DRO objects:

- FulfillmentStepDefinitionGroups
- FulfillmentStepDefinitions (with dynamic user resolution)
- FulfillmentStepDependencyDefs
- ProductFulfillmentDecompRules
- ProductDecompEnrichmentRules
- ProductFulfillmentScenarios
- FulfillmentFalloutRules + FulfillmentStepJeopardyRules
- FulfillmentTaskAssignmentRules
- FulfillmentWorkspaces + WorkspaceItems

> **Known build-side bug:** 260 has a known issue where `ExecuteOnRuleId` is not generated on `INSERT` of `ProductFulfillmentDecompRule` / `ProductFulfillmentScenario` / `FulfillmentStepDefinition` / `FulfillmentTaskAssignmentRule`. The `update_product_fulfillment_decomp_rules` Apex task is run as Step 4 of `prepare_dro` to trigger ruleset generation by editing-and-resaving each PFDR record. (Confirmed in #rlm-office-hours.)

## 15. Customer Account Setup

> The `scratch_data` data plan provisions canonical **end-customer accounts** for QB workshop scenarios. Per project guidance, this is the source of truth for customers in QB-aligned exercises.

| Object | Records |
|---|---|
| Account | **Infinitech** (San Francisco, US, Technology) · **Global Media / GBM** (Toronto, Canada, Media) |
| Contact | Seth Wilson @ Infinitech · Geoff Minor + Carole White @ Global Media |
| BillingAccount | **Infinitech Billing Account** (USD, Default Payment Term, DefaultInvoiceTemplate, Bill-To: Seth Wilson) |

**Workshop role assignments:**

- **Infinitech is the primary customer** for end-to-end walkthroughs. Has full billing setup (BillingAccount + payment term + invoice template + bill-to contact) — minimal additional configuration needed to run quote-to-cash exercises.
- **Global Media** is the secondary customer. Useful for multi-account scenarios, multi-region examples (Canada-based), and demos that need a contrast to Infinitech.
- **Robot Resellers** (from `qb-prm`) is the **partner channel** — the reseller through which Infinitech can be sold to. Enables PRM walkthroughs.

## 16. `prepare_rlm_org` Build Flow Summary

The full 34-step build process is documented at `docs/guides/prepare-rlm-org-build-guide.md`. Phases:

1. **Foundation (1–3):** PSL/PSG assignment, context definition extension, decision tables, expression sets (deactivate)
2. **Metadata Deployment (4–7):** Payments site, deploy_full, price adjustment schedule activation, QuantumBit metadata
3. **Product Catalog & Pricing (8–9):** PCM data + product images + pricing data
4. **Business Process Configuration (10–17):** DocGen, DRO, Tax, Billing, Collections, Analytics, CLM, Rating
5. **Expression Sets & Permissions (18–22):** Expression set activation (active), TSO permissions, procedure plans, PRM, Agentforce
6. **Constraints & Guided Selling (23–24):** `prepare_constraints` (metadata + CML imports), guided selling
7. **Final Configuration & Personalization (25–32):** Revenue settings, pricing discovery, ramp builder, large STX, personas, UX assembly, In-App Learning, scratch seed data
8. **Finalization (33–35):** Decision table refresh, search index rebuild, git commit stamp

Critical feature flags driving the flow:
- `qb=true` (QuantumBit data shape, default)
- `billing=true`, `tax=true`, `dro=true`, `rating=true`, `rates=true`, `clm=true`, `prm=true`, `docgen=true`, `constraints=true`, `constraints_data=true`
- `tso=false` (Trialforce Source Org mode, off for dev orgs)

## Gaps + Recommendations for Master Exercise Series

The QB org is rich and well-constructed for workshops. With customers in `scratch_data` recognized as the canonical source, most prior "gaps" are resolved. The remaining items are minor and optional.

### What's already there (no gap)

- ✅ **End-customer accounts** — Infinitech (US, full billing setup) + Global Media (Canada) provisioned by `scratch_data`
- ✅ **Partner channel** — Robot Resellers in `qb-prm` with 4-tier Reseller Program (Platinum / Gold / Silver / Bronze)
- ✅ Multi-currency (7 currencies, USD corporate)
- ✅ Multi-Legal-Entity (4 LEs covering NA + EU + UK with Advance + Arrears Billing Treatments per LE)
- ✅ Two CML constraint models active: QuantumBitBundle + Server2 with full Port/Type semantics (QuantumBitBundle = QuantumBitComplete bundle + QuantumBitPCM cart rules; QuantumBitComplete and QuantumBitPCM imported but inactive)
- ✅ Component groups with min/max quantity enforcement (QB-COMPLETE Usage = exactly 1, QB-BDL-R750 components each = exactly 1)
- ✅ Nested component groups (QB-QRack-750: Computing → Cooling, Storage → Hard Drives, PCIe → GPUs / I/O / Networking)
- ✅ Pricing-feature wiring on QB-COMPLETE — Bundle (QB-API 5%), Attribute (QB-API environment override), Volume (QB-MSG-STRT tiered), Derived (2 entries)
- ✅ All 9 SellingModel records (One-Time + 4 Term-Defined frequencies + 4 Evergreen frequencies)
- ✅ All 10 usage-product variants (multi-resource, token, monetary, quantity, commitment flat/each/tiered/bounded, target-bound packs)
- ✅ DRO fulfillment scenarios for QB products
- ✅ Tax engine + treatments per LE
- ✅ DocGen template foundation

### Remaining minor gaps (optional fills)

| Gap | Impact | Proposed fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Multi-LE BillingAccounts on the same customer** | Currently Infinitech has 1 BillingAccount (US LE). Multi-region demos need per-LE BillingAccounts on the same Account. | Optional: extend `scratch_data/BillingAccount.csv` with additional per-LE BillingAccount records for Infinitech (e.g., Canada LE for a Toronto branch, UK LE for a London branch). |
| **Pre-built starter Opportunity / Quote for Infinitech** | Master exercises need a starting Quote to demonstrate downstream features (approvals, DRO, billing) without forcing every workshop attendee to manually configure a long quote first. | Optional: add a small `qb-opportunities` plan with 1–2 sample Opportunity + Quote records that exercise bundle config + ramp + multi-product-mix. |
| **Sample contracts for CLM exercises** | Existing `qb-clm` is design-time templates; no actual customer contracts to amend. | Optional: add 1–2 sample Contract records linked to Infinitech. |
| **Non-USD PricebookEntries** | Multi-currency is provisioned, but PricebookEntries are USD-only. | Optional: per-currency PriceBookEntry overlays for sample bundles (e.g., GBP variants for UK-LE walkthroughs). |
| **Pre-built Price Propagation rules** | Price Propagation feature requires nested groups (✅ in QB-QRack-750) and a configured propagation table (no pre-built). | **Treat as a feature** — workshop attendees configure the propagation table during the Price Propagation walkthrough, exercising the Spring '26 Pricing Propagation Preview design-time tooling. |

> None of these are blocking. The workshop scenario below is fully runnable against the current QB data shape.

### Recommended workshop scenario

> **Scenario — "Infinitech consolidates cloud infrastructure on QuantumBit, with Global Media as a secondary customer for multi-account walkthroughs."**
>
> Infinitech is a Technology company headquartered in San Francisco (US). They're moving from on-prem to QuantumBit's cloud platform, deploying both software (QB-COMPLETE solution) and hardware (QB-QRack-750 servers) to support production, pre-production, and government workloads.
>
> The deal exercises:
>
> - **QB-COMPLETE** bundle as the software foundation, with the **QuantumBitBundle CML** (the active model — it contains QuantumBitComplete's full bundle configuration plus PCM cart-level rules) enforcing valid configurations
>   - **QB-API** with environment attribute set to `Prod` ($15,000/year via attribute-based pricing) for the production environment, plus additional QB-API instances at `Pre-Prod` ($12,000) and `Gov` ($8,500) attribute values
>   - **5% bundle adjustment** applied automatically via QB-COMPLETE's bundle relationship
>   - **QB-MSG-STRT** at 16+ units → **25% volume discount** for high-volume messaging
>   - One usage product (required by `QB-PCG-USAGE` min/max=1) — typically `QB-DB` for the database tier, with optional `QB-TOKENS-PACK` for AI/automation
>   - **QB-BDL-SRVC** Professional Services Bundle for migration
> - **QB-QRack-750** server racks for hardware deployment, with the **Server2 CML** enforcing valid CPU + Memory + Cooling + Power + Networking + Storage combinations across nested component groups
> - **Term Annual** selling model for software subscriptions; **One-Time** for hardware
> - Optional: secondary customer footprint via **Global Media** (Toronto, Canada LE) for multi-account demos
> - Optional: deal flowed through **Robot Resellers** (Reseller Program: Platinum tier with 6% discount) for PRM walkthroughs
>
> Per-office multi-LE billing as needed: US LE for HQ, Canada LE for Global Media demos, EU/UK LE for international expansion examples.

This scenario:

- **Threads through every master exercise** — PCM (catalog setup), Pricing (all four feature types live in QB-COMPLETE), Configurator (CML for both software + hardware bundles), Transaction Mgmt (multi-product quote with ramps + approvals), Approvals (high-value tiered approval), DRO (multi-bundle fulfillment), Usage (the QB-COMPLETE usage component group), Invoice/Billing (Infinitech BillingAccount → Default Payment Term → invoices), Context Service (the data layer powering all of this)
