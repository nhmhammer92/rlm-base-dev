# ERD Quick Start Guide

## View Individual Domain Diagrams

Copy the content of any `.mermaid` file and paste it into:
- [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
- GitHub (preview in browser)
- VS Code with Mermaid extension

### Example: View PCM Diagram

```bash
cat docs/erds/pcm.mermaid
```

Then paste into Mermaid Live Editor.

## View the Interactive HTML Viewer

```bash
# Open in browser
open docs/erds/revenue-cloud-erd.html

# Or from command line
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000/docs/erds/revenue-cloud-erd.html
```

## Legend

### Relationship Symbols (Mermaid)

```
}o--||  = Many-to-one (Lookup)
||--o{  = One-to-many (Master-Detail)
||--||  = One-to-one
```

### Colors (in HTML Viewer)

Each domain has a distinct color for easy visual identification:
- PCM: Red
- Pricing: Teal
- Rate Management: Blue
- Configurator: Light Salmon
- Transaction Management: Light Green
- DRO: Yellow
- Usage Management: Purple
- Billing: Light Blue

## Common Queries

### "Which objects reference Product2?"

Open `revenue-cloud-erd.html`, search for "Product2", and observe all connected nodes.

### "What are all the billing-related objects?"

Open `billing.mermaid` to see all 54 billing domain objects in one diagram.

### "How do orders connect to invoices?"

Open `master.mermaid` to see the cross-domain flow: Order → BillingSchedule → Invoice.

### "What are the immediate dependencies of an Asset?"

Search for "Asset" in the HTML viewer; nodes directly connected are immediate dependencies.

## Regenerating ERDs

If `erd-data.json` changes, regenerate the HTML viewer:

```bash
python3 scripts/erd/build_erds.py
```

This rebuilds `revenue-cloud-erd.html` from current `erd-data.json` data. The Mermaid `.mermaid` files are relationship-focused summaries that may need manual updates if domain structure shifts significantly.

To refresh `erd-data.json` itself against a fresh org or new release, see `.cursor/skills/schema-validation/SKILL.md` for the full workflow.
