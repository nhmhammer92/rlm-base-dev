# Revenue Cloud Entity Relationship Diagrams

This directory contains comprehensive entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) for the Revenue Cloud Base Foundations project, generated from `erd-data.json`.

**Current baseline:** Release 262 (Summer '26, API v67.0) — **263 objects, 4,190 platform fields, 674 relationships** across 9 domains.

The ERD reflects **canonical Revenue Cloud platform schema only** — custom fields (any `__c` suffix, including project `RLM_*__c` and managed packages) are excluded by validation tooling. Verified via dual-org cross-validation (260 baseline `ent-r1` and 262 target `rlm-base__ent-sb0`) plus 127 entities individually checked against Core UDD source at `gitcore.soma.salesforce.com/core-2206/core-262-public@p4/262-patch`.

Per-object 262 schema changes are summarized below. The 260 → 262 delta is **field-level additive** (45 fields added, 0 removed, 0 type changes, 2 polymorphic-reference targets expanded — e.g. `Invoice.ReferenceEntityId` now also accepts `Opportunity`/`Quote`) with **value-level picklist deltas** of 243 added and 62 removed. The picklist removals are IANA TimeZone renames (e.g. `America/Catamarca` → `America/Argentina/Catamarca`, `Europe/Kiev` → `Europe/Kyiv`) and cleanup of unused industry-specific `UsageType` values (`InsuranceRuleAction`, `StageManagement`) on fulfillment objects; the picklist-removal audit tabulated the full breakdown. Each removed value was cross-referenced against every CSV under `datasets/sfdmu/{qb,q3,mfg}/**` — **zero maintained-plan rows reference any removed value**. Nine objects with deltas appear in existing SFDMU plans per `scripts/erd/schema_diff/260-vs-262-diff.md`, but **no SFDMU remediation is required**: additive fields can't break loads, and the removed picklist values aren't in use.

  - Regenerate via `scripts/erd/validate_erd_against_org.py --org <alias> --patch` after schema changes

## How to Use

### Viewing Mermaid Diagrams

Mermaid files can be viewed in several ways:

1. **GitHub** — Automatically renders `.mermaid` files in browser
2. **Mermaid Live Editor** — https://mermaid.live/
   - Copy-paste diagram content from `.mermaid` files
3. **VS Code** — Install "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
4. **Local Preview** — Use any Markdown preview that supports Mermaid

### Using the Interactive HTML Viewer

1. Open `revenue-cloud-erd.html` in any modern web browser
2. No installation or build required
3. Use the sidebar to:
   - Filter domains (checkboxes)
   - Search for objects (text input)
   - View statistics
4. Interact with the graph:
   - Hover over nodes to see details
   - Click and drag to pan
   - Scroll to zoom in/out
   - Drag nodes to reposition

## Understanding Relationship Types

### Mermaid Notation

- `}o--||` — Many-to-one (child → parent, typically a Lookup field)
- `||--o{` — One-to-many (parent → child, Master-Detail)
- `||--||` — One-to-one

### Salesforce Relationship Types

- **Lookup** — Optional relationship; child can exist without parent
- **Master-Detail** — Required relationship; child cannot exist without parent
- **Polymorphic** — Field can reference multiple object types (e.g., OwnerId)

## Statistics

- **Total Objects:** 263
- **Total Fields:** 4,190 (canonical platform fields only; custom fields excluded)
- **Total Relationships:** 674 (unique cross-object lookups)
- **Total Domains:** 9 (PCM, Pricing, Rates, Configurator, Transactions, Approvals, DRO, Usage, Billing)
- **Last verified:** 2026-05-27 (260 + 262 cross-validation, 127 entities checked against Core UDD source)

## Maintenance

The current ERD was built by combining the original v260 Developer Guide PDF extraction with org-introspection cross-validation against fresh `prepare_rlm_org`-built scratch orgs (260 + 262), then individually verifying 127 entities against canonical Core UDD source. Mermaid domain files are relationship-focused summaries.

To refresh after a schema change or new release:

1. Build a fresh scratch org from the target release branch
2. Run `python scripts/erd/validate_erd_against_org.py --org <alias> --patch` to add new fields and relationships
3. Run `python scripts/erd/cleanup_orphan_erd_fields.py --orgs <260>,<262> --dry-run` to identify candidates for cleanup
4. Run `python scripts/erd/build_erds.py` to regenerate the HTML viewer
5. Re-validate: `python scripts/erd/validate_erd_against_org.py --org <alias> --report docs/erds/validation-report.md` and confirm only the **expected feature-gated gaps** remain (diff against the committed `validation-report.md`; the current expected baseline is 9 feature-gated objects unfindable in a default RLM scratch profile — `AssetDowntimePeriod`, `AssetOwnerSharingRule`, `AssetShare`, `AssetTag`, `AssetWarranty`, `PricingProcedureResolution`, `ProductPriceHistoryLog`, `ProductPriceRange`, `ProductSellingModelDataTranslation` — plus 33 objects with cross-cloud / version-gated field gaps and 822 ERD-side fields that don't surface in a stock org but were verified against Core UDD source). A clean refresh produces **zero NEW gaps** vs the committed baseline, not zero gaps absolute.
