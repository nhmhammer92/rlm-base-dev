# Revenue Cloud Base Foundations

**Salesforce Release:** 262 (Summer '26)
**API Version:** 67.0

This repository automates the creation and configuration of Salesforce environments that require Revenue Cloud (formerly Revenue Lifecycle Management) functionality.

The `main` branch targets Salesforce Release 262 (Summer '26), promoted from the `262` upgrade branch. Release 260 (Spring '26) is the prior GA reference, preserved on the `release/260` branch.

## Docker build environment (no local toolchain)

Don't want to install Python, Node, CumulusCI, the Salesforce CLI, and SFDMU
locally? A self-contained Docker image bundles the **entire toolchain**, a
snapshot of this repo, and a bundled Claude Code agent behind one friendly `rlm`
command — so someone who doesn't know GitHub, CumulusCI, or `sf` can connect
orgs, build them, and customize them:

```bash
./docker/rlm setup           # build the image once (or `pull` a published one)
./docker/rlm login --devhub  # sign in via your browser
./docker/rlm build           # create + fully configure a scratch org
./docker/rlm up              # persistent workspace to attach Cursor / VS Code / Claude Code
```

It also ships a `.devcontainer/` so you can open the repo **inside** the image
from Cursor or VS Code. Full guide: [`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md). The
rest of this section covers the traditional local (pyenv/nvm) setup.

## macOS Environment Setup (Homebrew + pyenv + nvm)

> **Cursor users:** Open this README in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), press `Cmd+L` to open the AI chat, and paste: *"Walk me through the macOS Environment Setup section of this README, running each command in the terminal."* The agent can execute each step interactively. Run the steps in order — each one builds on the previous.

> **For the layered/canonical view** (shell config architecture, per-project
> `.envrc` activation via direnv, major-line pin strategy, and the
> `scripts/bash/update-toolchain.sh` maintenance routine), see
> [`docs/guides/dev-environment-setup.md`](docs/guides/dev-environment-setup.md).
> Steps 1–11 below are the first-time bootstrap; the guide describes the
> target architecture and ongoing maintenance you'll move to after that.

This section walks through a full, clean environment setup on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for package management, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python version management, and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js version management. Using version managers (pyenv + nvm) keeps your tool installations isolated from the macOS system Python and Node, avoiding conflicts when multiple projects need different versions. Skip any step for tools you already have installed.

### Step 1 — Install Homebrew

If you don't have Homebrew installed, run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the post-install instructions to add Homebrew to your `PATH` (shown at the end of the installer output). Then verify:

```bash
brew --version
```

### Step 2 — Install core tools (git, gh, GCM)

```bash
# Install git (version control)
brew install git

# Install GitHub CLI (gh) — used for PR workflows, cloning private repos, etc.
brew install gh

# Install Git Credential Manager (recommended) — secure credential storage for HTTPS git operations
brew install --cask git-credential-manager
```

Verify and authenticate:

```bash
git --version
gh --version

# Authenticate with GitHub (if you haven't already)
gh auth login
```

### Step 3 — Install Node.js via nvm

[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) lets you install and switch between Node.js versions without touching the system Node. This is the recommended approach if you manage multiple projects — it prevents conflicts between the sf CLI's Node dependency and any other Node-based tools on your system.

> **Why nvm over `brew install node`?** Homebrew installs a single Node version system-wide. nvm lets you pin projects to specific Node versions and keeps global npm packages (like `@salesforce/cli`) tied to the version they were installed with.
>
> **Node LTS versions only:** Always use an even-numbered LTS release (v20, v22, v24) for tooling. Odd-numbered releases (v21, v23, v25) are short-lived "Current" releases with no long-term support — they reach end-of-life within 6 months and are not suitable for developer tools.

```bash
# Install nvm via Homebrew
brew install nvm

# Add nvm to your interactive shell (~/.zshrc)
echo 'export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[ -s "$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[ -s "$(brew --prefix nvm)/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && \. "$(brew --prefix nvm)/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Also add nvm to ~/.zshenv so non-interactive shells see it
# (required for IDE tools, CI runners, and Claude Code which spawn non-interactive shells)
# Homebrew is often only on PATH in login shells (~/.zprofile); fall back to known absolute
# locations so this works in non-interactive shells that never source ~/.zprofile.
echo 'export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"' >> ~/.zshenv
echo '# Bootstrap Homebrew in non-interactive shells' >> ~/.zshenv
echo 'if ! command -v brew >/dev/null 2>&1; then' >> ~/.zshenv
echo '  for _brew in /opt/homebrew/bin/brew /usr/local/bin/brew; do' >> ~/.zshenv
echo '    [ -x "$_brew" ] && eval "$($_brew shellenv)" && break' >> ~/.zshenv
echo '  done' >> ~/.zshenv
echo 'fi' >> ~/.zshenv
echo 'if command -v brew >/dev/null 2>&1; then' >> ~/.zshenv
echo '  NVM_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix nvm 2>/dev/null)"' >> ~/.zshenv
echo '  if [ -n "$NVM_PREFIX" ] && [ -s "$NVM_PREFIX/nvm.sh" ]; then' >> ~/.zshenv
echo '    \. "$NVM_PREFIX/nvm.sh"' >> ~/.zshenv
echo '  fi' >> ~/.zshenv
echo 'fi' >> ~/.zshenv

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Install the latest LTS version of Node.js
nvm install --lts

# Set LTS as the default for all new shells
nvm alias default lts/*

# Verify
node --version   # Should show an even-numbered LTS version (v20, v22, v24, …)
npm --version
```

> **After setup, restart your terminal** (or any IDE/tool that spawns shells) so the updated PATH takes effect in all contexts.

If you already have `brew install node` and want to migrate to nvm, remove the Homebrew version after installing nvm — it is no longer needed:
```bash
brew uninstall node   # safe after nvm is installed and default is set
```

### Step 4 — Install pyenv and Python

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) lets you install and switch between Python versions without touching the system Python.

**Python 3.12 or 3.13 is recommended for CumulusCI** — both are stable and tested with CCI 4.x. Python 3.14 is very new (released October 2025) and has known dependency compatibility issues. Avoid it for CCI.

```bash
# Install pyenv
brew install pyenv

# Add pyenv to your interactive shell (~/.zshrc)
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Also add pyenv to ~/.zshenv for non-interactive shells
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshenv
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshenv
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshenv

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Install the latest 3.13.x patch automatically
PYTHON_VERSION=$(pyenv install --list | grep -E "^[[:space:]]*3\.13\.[0-9]+$" | tail -1 | tr -d '[:space:]')
pyenv install "$PYTHON_VERSION"
pyenv global "$PYTHON_VERSION"

# Verify
python --version   # Should show the latest 3.13.x patch
```

> **Using multiple Python versions?** You can install additional versions alongside (for example, another 3.12.x or 3.13.x patch) and switch per-project with a `.python-version` file. Keep whichever version you use for CCI consistent with what you pass to `pipx install cumulusci --python`.

> **Non-interactive shell note:** The `~/.zshenv` additions above ensure that IDE tools, CI runners, and Claude Code (which spawn non-interactive shells) can find your pyenv-managed Python. Without `~/.zshenv`, only interactive terminal sessions see pyenv.

### Step 5 — Create and activate a virtual environment (venv)

After cloning the repository (Step 8 below), create a project-specific virtual environment. This isolates the project's Python dependencies from your system and other projects.

> **If you install CumulusCI via pipx (recommended, Step 6), you do not need to manually install packages into this venv** — pipx manages CCI in its own isolated environment. Still create a venv if you want to run project scripts (`scripts/`, `tasks/`) directly outside of CCI, or if you choose `pip install cumulusci` instead.

```bash
# From the repo root (uses whichever Python pyenv points to — 3.12 recommended)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Your prompt should now show (.venv) prefix
# Verify
python --version
pip --version
```

To deactivate the venv when you're done:

```bash
deactivate
```

> **Tip:** Add `.venv/` to your `.gitignore` if it isn't already (this project's `.gitignore` covers it).

### Step 6 — Install CumulusCI

**Recommended: use pipx** — pipx installs CumulusCI in its own isolated Python environment, keeping it separate from your project venv and system Python.

```bash
# Install pipx via pyenv's Python — keeps all Python tooling under pyenv, not Homebrew
# Uses the pyenv global set in Step 4 ($(pyenv prefix) resolves to that version)
$(pyenv prefix)/bin/python3 -m pip install --user pipx

# Ensure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH (pipx installs cci, snowfakery, etc. there)
$(pyenv prefix)/bin/python3 -m pipx ensurepath
source ~/.zshrc

# Install CumulusCI using the same Python version
pipx install cumulusci --python "$(pyenv prefix)/bin/python3"

# Verify
cci version   # Should show CumulusCI 4.x running on Python 3.13.x
```

> **Note on setuptools:** Earlier versions of this guide instructed `pipx inject cumulusci "setuptools<71"` to work around a `pkg_resources` issue in `pyfilesystem2`. This pin is **no longer needed or valid** — modern CumulusCI (4.8+) with snowfakery 4.x requires `setuptools>=75.4`, making the `<71` pin incompatible. If you have an older CCI install with the pin, remove it: `pipx inject --force cumulusci "setuptools>=75.4"`.

If you prefer to use the project venv instead (activate it first per Step 5, then):

```bash
pip install cumulusci
cci version
```

### Step 7 — Install Salesforce CLI (`sf`)

Install `@salesforce/cli` via npm using the nvm-managed Node from Step 3. This is the Salesforce-recommended installation method.

```bash
# Install sf CLI globally via npm (nvm-managed Node must be active)
npm install -g @salesforce/cli

# Verify (must be 2.x or later)
sf --version   # Should show @salesforce/cli/2.x darwin-arm64 node-v24.x.x
```

> **Why npm instead of Homebrew?** The Homebrew `sf` formula and `--cask sf` cask bundle their own copy of Node.js independently of nvm. This creates redundant Node installations and potential version conflicts. Installing via npm ties sf to your nvm-managed Node version, giving you a single Node installation to manage.

> **After switching from Homebrew sf to npm:** If you previously had `brew install --cask sf` or `brew install sf`, remove it first: `brew uninstall sf`. The Homebrew cask is also deprecated and scheduled for removal on 2026-09-01.

> **npm globals and nvm versions:** npm global packages (like `@salesforce/cli`) are installed per nvm Node version. If you switch Node versions with `nvm use`, run `npm install -g @salesforce/cli` again in the new version, or use `nvm reinstall-packages <old-version>` to copy all globals.

### Step 8 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rlm-base-dev
```

> Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual repo URL from GitHub (use `gh repo clone <org>/<repo>` if you used `gh auth login` above).

### Step 9 — Install SFDMU plugin (v5.6.4+)

SFDMU is a Salesforce CLI plugin for bulk data loading. **Version 5.6.4 or later is required** (5.6.4 fixed upsert matching for relationship-traversal externalIds; older 5.x releases duplicate records on rerun).

```bash
sf plugins install sfdmu

# Verify (should show 5.6.4 or later)
sf plugins list
```

### Step 10 — Authenticate with Salesforce

```bash
# For a standard org
sf org login web

# For a Dev Hub (required for scratch orgs)
sf org login web --alias devhub --instance-url https://login.salesforce.com

# Set your default org for CCI
cci org default <your-org-alias>
```

### Step 11 — Verify the full setup

Run the built-in setup validator (no org connection required):

```bash
cci task run validate_setup
```

This checks Python, CumulusCI, Salesforce CLI, SFDMU plugin version, Node.js, and Robot Framework dependencies. Robot Framework, selenium (4.10+), and SeleniumLibrary are **required**; `validate_setup` ensures that either `webdriver-manager` is installed in the CCI environment (preferred) or a compatible `chromedriver` binary is available on PATH. When `auto_fix_robot` is true (default), missing or outdated Robot Framework pieces (including selenium) are auto-installed via `pipx inject cumulusci --force -r robot/requirements.txt`. Chrome or Chromium must be installed manually — `validate_setup` will report FAIL if no supported browser is found. A passing summary confirms your environment is ready.

> **What is and isn't auto-fixed:** `validate_setup` auto-fixes the SFDMU plugin version, Robot Framework deps (Robot, selenium>=4.10, SeleniumLibrary, webdriver-manager via `pipx inject cumulusci --force -r robot/requirements.txt`), and optionally urllib3 (`auto_fix_urllib3=true`). It does **not** auto-install sf CLI, Node.js, Python, or Chrome/Chromium — those must be installed manually. Install Chrome before running flows: `brew install --cask google-chrome` (macOS) or your distribution's chromium package (Linux).

### Using Claude Code with this project

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) spawns **non-interactive shells** (it does not source `~/.zshrc`). Without `~/.zshenv`, Claude Code's Bash tool cannot find nvm-managed Node (`sf`, `node`) or pyenv-managed Python (`python`, `cci`). Steps 3 and 4 above add the required init blocks to `~/.zshenv` — if you skipped those additions, add them now.

**Verify Claude Code can see your tools** by asking it to run:

```bash
node --version && sf --version && cci version && python --version
```

If any command returns "not found", check that `~/.zshenv` contains the nvm and pyenv init blocks (see Steps 3 and 4), then **restart Claude Code** so it picks up the updated PATH.

**After any PATH change** (new nvm version, new pyenv version, new pipx install), restart Claude Code — it inherits the PATH from the shell that launched it and does not reload `~/.zshenv` mid-session.

### Ongoing toolchain maintenance

Once the bootstrap above is complete, ongoing updates (new Python patches,
Node LTS refreshes, sf/CCI/SFDMU upgrades) are handled by a single script:

```bash
scripts/bash/update-toolchain.sh
```

It walks `brew update && brew upgrade` → latest patch in your pinned Python line → latest LTS Node → `sf update` → CCI reinstall/upgrade → `sf plugins update` → `cci task run validate_setup`. Major-line pins (e.g. Python 3.13, Node `lts/*`) are configured at the top of the script.

For the full architecture — shell config responsibilities, the per-project `.envrc` pattern via [direnv](https://direnv.net/), troubleshooting, and instructions for replicating on a new workstation — see [`docs/guides/dev-environment-setup.md`](docs/guides/dev-environment-setup.md).

**Validating the full setup from Claude Code:** Ask Claude to run `cci task run validate_setup`. This checks all required tools and — when the relevant auto-fix options are enabled — can auto-fix missing robot deps (default on) and update the SFDMU version (default on). urllib3 is upgraded as a side-effect of the robot dep fix, or independently with `auto_fix_urllib3=true`. No org connection needed. It is the fastest way to confirm your environment is ready before running flows.

## Prerequisites

> **macOS users:** See [macOS Environment Setup (Homebrew + pyenv + nvm)](#macos-environment-setup-homebrew--pyenv--nvm) for a step-by-step guide using Homebrew, pyenv (Python), nvm (Node.js), and pipx — including git, gh, GCM, and Cursor integration.

### Required Software

1. **git**
   - Installation (macOS): `brew install git` — or use the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
   - Verify: `git --version`

2. **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) — recommended
   - Used for cloning, PR workflows, and authentication
   - Installation: `brew install gh` (macOS) — see https://cli.github.com/
   - Verify: `gh --version`
   - Authenticate: `gh auth login`

3. **Git Credential Manager** (GCM) — recommended
   - Provides secure, cross-platform credential storage for HTTPS git operations
   - Installation: `brew install --cask git-credential-manager` (macOS) — see https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager
   - Configured automatically after installation

4. **Salesforce CLI** (`sf` CLI)
   - Version 2.x or later; requires an LTS Node.js (v20, v22, or v24 — **not** odd-numbered releases like v25 which are unsupported)
   - Installation (macOS): `npm install -g @salesforce/cli` — see https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli
   - Verify: `sf --version`

5. **CumulusCI** (CCI)
   - Minimum version: 4.0.0 (as specified in `cumulusci.yml`)
   - Installation: **prefer** `pipx install cumulusci --python "$(pyenv prefix)/bin/python3"` (ensure your pyenv global is set to a supported version — 3.12 or 3.13). If you don't use pipx: create a virtual environment and run `pip install cumulusci` inside it.
   - Verify: `cci version`

6. **SFDMU (Salesforce Data Move Utility)**
   - **Version 5.6.4 or later required** (v4.x is no longer supported; pre-5.6.4 5.x breaks Upsert matching on relationship externalIds)
   - Required for data loading tasks
   - Installation: `sf plugins install sfdmu`
   - Verify: `sf plugins list` (should show sfdmu 5.6.4 or later)
   - The `validate_setup` task checks and auto-updates the SFDMU version
   - Documentation: https://help.sfdmu.com/

7. **Node.js** — required by the `sf` CLI and SFDMU plugin
   - Use an LTS version (even-numbered: v20, v22, v24); odd-numbered releases (v21, v23, v25) are not supported by sf CLI
   - Installation (macOS): `brew install nvm` then `nvm install --lts` (recommended) — see Step 3 in the macOS setup guide
   - Verify: `node --version`

8. **Python** (for custom tasks and the repo's AI/schema-diff scripts)
   - Python 3.10 or later; **3.12 recommended** for CumulusCI (3.13 is what the CI workflow uses and is the dev-environment-setup default; 3.14 has known dependency compatibility issues). The 3.10 floor matches what the schema-diff and skill-manifest scripts already use (PEP 604 unions).
   - macOS: use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) — `brew install pyenv` — to manage versions
   - Required packages are included with CumulusCI; use a venv for local script development

### Required Salesforce Access

- Salesforce org with Revenue Cloud licenses
- Appropriate permissions for metadata deployment
- For scratch orgs: Dev Hub enabled

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rlm-base-dev
   ```

2. **Install CumulusCI:**
   ```bash
   pipx install cumulusci
   ```
   Prefer **pipx** so CumulusCI runs in an isolated environment and does not install into your global Python. If you don't use pipx, create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) first, then run `pip install cumulusci` inside it.

   #### Setup for headless robot runs

   Required if you use Robot-backed setup tasks such as `prepare_docgen`, `enable_document_builder_toggle`, `enable_constraints_settings`, `configure_revenue_settings`, `configure_core_pricing_setup`, `configure_product_discovery_settings`, `enable_timeline`, or `reorder_app_launcher`:

   1. **Python packages** — Robot Framework, selenium (4.10+), SeleniumLibrary, webdriver-manager, urllib3. Keep them in the **same environment as CumulusCI** so CCI tasks can run the `robot` command. A full dependency set is in **`robot/requirements.txt`**. If you use **pipx** for CumulusCI (recommended):
     ```bash
     pipx inject cumulusci --force -r robot/requirements.txt
     ```
     If you use a project virtual environment: `pip install -r robot/requirements.txt` inside the venv. If you previously installed these globally, uninstall first: `python3 -m pip uninstall -y robotframework-seleniumlibrary robotframework selenium webdriver-manager`.

     > **selenium 4.10+ required:** The `executable_path` argument was removed from the Chrome WebDriver in selenium 4.10. The `robot/requirements.txt` pins `selenium>=4.10,<5`. If you have an older selenium installed, `cci task run validate_setup` will detect and auto-upgrade it.

   2. **Chrome or Chromium** — Robot tasks run headless by default and require Chrome or Chromium. (Use `BROWSER=firefox` to run with Firefox instead.)
     - **macOS:** Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or `brew install chromium`
     - **Linux:** `apt install chromium` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `dnf install chromium` (Fedora)
     - **CI:** Set `CHROME_BIN` to the browser path (e.g. `/usr/bin/chromium`)

   3. **ChromeDriver** — webdriver-manager downloads it automatically at runtime. If webdriver-manager is not installed, ChromeDriver must be on `PATH` or at `/usr/bin/chromedriver` (e.g. `apt install chromium-driver` on Debian/Ubuntu).

   4. **Salesforce CLI** — The task uses `sf org open --url-only` to authenticate the browser; ensure `sf` is installed and the org is logged in.

   5. **Verify** — Run `cci task run validate_setup` (no org required) to check all dependencies including Chrome/Chromium and ChromeDriver.

3. **Install SFDMU (v5.6.4+):**
   ```bash
   sf plugins install sfdmu
   ```

4. **Verify installations:**
   ```bash
   sf --version
   cci version
   sf plugins list  # Should show sfdmu 5.x
   ```
   **Headless robot env — no org or flow required:** To confirm all headless robot dependencies (Robot, SeleniumLibrary, webdriver-manager, Chrome/Chromium, ChromeDriver, urllib3), run:
   ```bash
   cci task run validate_setup
   ```
   Or manually: `~/.local/pipx/venvs/cumulusci/bin/robot --version` and `~/.local/pipx/venvs/cumulusci/bin/python -c "import SeleniumLibrary; print('SeleniumLibrary OK')"` (pipx path; on Windows use `...\Scripts\robot.bat`). If all checks pass, your env is ready for headless robot tasks when the org is configured.

5. **Authenticate with Salesforce:**
   ```bash
   sf org login web
   # OR for Dev Hub (for scratch orgs)
   sf org login web --alias devhub --instance-url https://login.salesforce.com
   ```

6. **Initialize CumulusCI:**
   ```bash
   cci org default <your-org-alias>
   ```

## Quick Start

### Create a Scratch Org

```bash
# Create a basic dev scratch org
cci org scratch dev <org-alias>

# Create an enterprise scratch org (with additional features like SalesCloudEinstein)
cci org scratch ent <org-alias>
```

### Deploy to an Existing Org

```bash
# Set default org
cci org default <org-alias>

# Run the main deployment flow
cci flow run prepare_rlm_org
```

### Reset default or target scratch org and run full flow

To remove your current default (or target) scratch org, create a new one, and run the full RLM prepare flow (includes billing data when applicable), use your scratch org config and alias (e.g. `beta`, `dev`, `ent`—see `orgs/` and `cumulusci.yml` under `orgs.scratch`):

```bash
# Delete existing scratch org (use the same alias you created it with)
cci org scratch_delete <org-alias>

# Create a new scratch org (config name and alias; set as default if desired)
cci org scratch <config-name> <org-alias> --default --days 30

# Run the full prepare flow on that org
cci flow run prepare_rlm_org --org <org-alias>
```

Decision tables under `unpackaged/pre/5_decisiontables` are deployed by this flow. Active decision tables are excluded per run by moving them into a `.skip` subdirectory before deploy (no `.forceignore` changes). Permission set groups are recalculated only when they are in **Outdated** state; if all are already **Updated**, the recalc step exits without waiting.

### List Available Flows and Tasks

```bash
cci flow list
cci task list
```

## Build Harness and TUI

Use the local build harness to profile, resume, and report on `prepare_rlm_org`
runs across the standard `dev` and `ent` scratch org scenarios:

```bash
python scripts/build_harness/harness.py run
python scripts/build_harness/harness.py report --run-id <run_id>
```

For an interactive scratch org build manager, launch the Textual TUI from the
repo root:

```bash
./tui-cci
```

See [`docs/guides/build-harness.md`](docs/guides/build-harness.md) for the full
CLI/TUI workflow, run artifacts, resume behavior, and test commands.

## Custom Tasks

This project includes custom Python task modules in the `tasks/` directory, each registered as one or more CCI tasks in `cumulusci.yml`.

### Data Management Tasks

Data management tasks are organized into two CCI groups so you can list or run by group:

- **Data Management - Extract** — SFDMU extract tasks (org → CSV). Output in `datasets/sfdmu/extractions/<plan_name>/<timestamp>`. **The same flow applies to every plan:** each task uses its plan directory from `cumulusci.yml`; post-process runs by default and writes re-import-ready CSVs to `<timestamp>/processed/`.
- **Data Management - Idempotency** — Idempotency test tasks (load twice, assert no record count increase; validates SFDMU v5 composite keys).

**List tasks by group:**

```bash
cci task list --group "Data Management - Extract"
cci task list --group "Data Management - Idempotency"
```

**Run all extract tasks or all idempotency tests (flows):**

```bash
cci flow run run_qb_extracts --org <org>
cci flow run run_qb_idempotency_tests --org <org>
```

| `post_process_extraction` | Revenue Lifecycle Management | Post-process extracted CSVs (composite keys, header normalization) for re-import; see `scripts/post_process_extraction.py` | See `cumulusci.yml` |
| `load_sfdmu_data` | Revenue Lifecycle Management | Load SFDMU data plans (generic; supports simulation, object_sets, dynamic DRO user) | See `cumulusci.yml` |

| `sync_pricing_data` | Revenue Lifecycle Management | Sync pricing data (PricebookEntry/PriceAdjustmentSchedule) | See `cumulusci.yml` |

Extract output is written to `datasets/sfdmu/extractions/<plan_name>/<timestamp>/`. **Post-process runs by default** after extraction; re-import-ready CSVs are in `<timestamp>/processed/`. To skip post-process (raw SFDMU output only), pass `run_post_process: false` (e.g. `cci task run extract_qb_pcm_data --org <org> -o run_post_process false`). You can also run `post_process_extraction` manually for an existing extraction. See [Composite Key Optimizations](docs/references/sfdmu-composite-key-optimizations.md).

**Supported plans:** `run_qb_extracts` covers the nine QB extract tasks listed above. Each extract task is wired to its plan directory in `cumulusci.yml`, and output paths are derived from that plan name (for example, `qb-pcm` -> `datasets/sfdmu/extractions/qb-pcm/<timestamp>/`). One-off extract tasks for adjacent plans such as qb-prm, qb-prm-pricing, qb-approvals, qb-billing, qb-tax, and scratch data remain standalone unless explicitly added to a batch flow.

### Apex Execution Tasks

| Task Class                      | Module               | Purpose                                              | Use Case                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FileBasedAnonymousApexTask`    | `rlm_apex_file.py`   | Execute large Apex scripts without URI limitations  | Fixes HTTP 414 errors for scripts >8KB; fully compatible with `AnonymousApexTask` |

**Why FileBasedAnonymousApexTask?**

CumulusCI's built-in `AnonymousApexTask` uses the Salesforce Tooling API's `executeAnonymous` endpoint with GET requests, which pass Apex code as URI parameters. This hits HTTP 414 URI Too Long errors for scripts exceeding ~8KB.

`FileBasedAnonymousApexTask` solves this by using `sf apex run --file`, which has no practical size limits and can handle scripts >100KB. It maintains full compatibility with all `AnonymousApexTask` options (path, apex, managed, namespaced, param1, param2) while providing:

- No URI length limitations
- Secure file handling with restricted permissions
- Comprehensive error handling (compilation/runtime errors)
- Support for namespace injection and parameter replacement

Currently used by `activate_rating_records` task for the large [activateRatingRecords.apex](scripts/apex/activateRatingRecords.apex) script (382 lines).

| Task Name | Suite | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `robot_e2e` | `quote_to_order.robot` | Full Quote-to-Order flow (headless Chrome) |
| `robot_e2e_debug` | `quote_to_order.robot` | Same flow in headed Chrome with CDP debugging (port 9222) |
| `robot_setup_quote` | `setup_quote.robot` | Part 1: Reset Account + Create Opportunity + Create Quote |
| `robot_order_from_quote` | `order_from_quote.robot` | Part 2: Add Products + Create Order + Activate + Verify Assets |
| `robot_reset_account` | `reset_account.robot` | Reset test Account (clear transactional data) |

```bash
# Full flow (headless)
cci task run robot_e2e --org beta

# Full flow (headed + CDP debug + pause points)
cci task run robot_e2e_debug -o pause_for_recording true --org beta

# Modular: setup quote only
cci task run robot_setup_quote --org beta

# Modular: order from existing quote
cci task run robot_order_from_quote --org beta
```

### App Launcher

App Launcher ordering is applied **dynamically** by `reorder_app_launcher` (step 2 of `prepare_ux`, step 29 of `prepare_rlm_org`, on all `ux=true` orgs). `assemble_and_deploy_ux` does **not** assemble or deploy appMenus — it only removes any stale `appMenus/` output left by older assembler versions. The task queries `AppMenuItem` via REST SOQL, builds an ordered `ApplicationId` list from its `priority_app_labels` option (a display-label priority list; see the task description for the default), and submits it to `AppLauncherController/saveOrder` via Aura XHR as a **user-level customization** for the automation user. No UI drag, and no Metadata API deploy — which is necessary because Salesforce blocks AppSwitcher Metadata API deployment on orgs whose AppMenu contains managed ConnectedApp or Network entries (the common Trialforce case), and `AppMenuItem.SortOrder` is read-only via all other APIs. Users who have already personalized their launcher may need "Reset to default" in the App Launcher.

To capture the running user's current order as a versioned reference snapshot:

```bash
# Writes templates/appMenus/base/AppSwitcher.appMenu-meta.xml — a reference snapshot, no deploy.
python scripts/sync_appmenu_from_user.py
```

The snapshot is **not** consumed by `reorder_app_launcher` (which orders by `priority_app_labels`); use it to review the current order or to inform that label list.

### Using Custom Tasks

All custom tasks are automatically available via CumulusCI. Use them like any standard CCI task:

```bash
# List decision tables (includes UsageType)
cci task run manage_decision_tables --operation list

# Validate decision table lists vs org
cci task run manage_decision_tables --operation validate_lists

# Manage flows
cci task run manage_flows --operation list --process_type ScreenFlow

# Manage expression sets
cci task run manage_expression_sets --operation list

# Export a constraint model
cci task run export_cml --org <org> -o developer_name QuantumBitComplete -o version 1 -o output_dir datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitComplete

# Import a constraint model (with dry run)
cci task run import_cml --org <org> -o data_dir datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitComplete -o dataset_dirs "datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm" -o dry_run true

# Validate CML files
cci task run validate_cml -o cml_dir scripts/cml -o data_dir datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitComplete
```

For detailed examples and usage, see:
- [Decision Table Examples](docs/references/decision-table-examples.md)
- [Flow and Expression Set Examples](docs/references/task-examples.md)
- [Constraints Utility Guide](datasets/constraints/README.md)

### Custom Task Development

Custom tasks are Python modules in the `tasks/` directory. They inherit from CumulusCI's `BaseTask` (or `BaseSalesforceTask` for org-connected tasks) and are automatically discovered by CumulusCI.

To add a new custom task:
1. Create a Python file in `tasks/` (e.g., `tasks/rlm_my_task.py`)
2. Define your task class inheriting from the appropriate base
3. Add task configuration to `cumulusci.yml` under `tasks:`
4. Reference the task in flows or run directly

Example task structure:
```python
from cumulusci.core.tasks import BaseTask
from cumulusci.core.exceptions import TaskOptionsError

class MyCustomTask(BaseTask):
    task_options = {
        "option1": {"description": "Description", "required": True}
    }
    
    def _run_task(self):
        # Task implementation
        pass
```

For tasks that need Salesforce org access (REST API, SOQL, etc.):
```python
from cumulusci.tasks.salesforce import BaseSalesforceTask

class MyOrgTask(BaseSalesforceTask):
    task_options = {
        "option1": {"description": "Description", "required": True}
    }
    
    def _run_task(self):
        # self.org_config provides access_token, instance_url, etc.
        pass
```

## Flows

All flows belong to the **Revenue Lifecycle Management** group. The main orchestration flow is `prepare_rlm_org`, which calls sub-flows in sequence.

### Main Orchestration

| Flow | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `prepare_rlm_org` | **Master flow** -- runs all sub-flows in order (34 steps). This is the primary flow for full org setup. |

> **Note:** "Always" means the flow/task runs as a step, but individual tasks inside each sub-flow may be gated by feature flags. Step 29 (`prepare_ux`) is gated by the `ux` flag (default `true`) and assembles all UX metadata — flexipages, layouts, applications, profiles, and object UX bindings — from `templates/` in a single late-stage deployment after all features are in place. Step 32 (`refresh_all_decision_tables`) refreshes all decision table caches. Step 33 (`rebuild_search_index`) rebuilds the Product Catalog (PCM) search index so the catalog is searchable after the build. Step 34 (`stamp_git_commit`) is always last.

### Data Management flows

Use these flows to run all QB extract tasks or all QB idempotency tests by group:

| Flow | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run_qb_extracts` | Runs all 9 Data Management - Extract tasks (extract_qb_pcm_data, extract_qb_pricing_data, extract_qb_product_images_data, extract_qb_dro_data, extract_qb_clm_data, extract_qb_rating_data, extract_qb_rates_data, extract_qb_transactionprocessingtypes_data, extract_qb_guidedselling_products_data). Requires `--org`. Output in `datasets/sfdmu/extractions/<plan>/<timestamp>/`. |
| `run_qb_idempotency_tests` | Runs the Data Management - Idempotency tasks: the 9 core tasks (incl. `test_qb_guidedselling_products_idempotency`) plus feature-gated tasks for tax, billing, PRM, approvals, and PRM pricing (steps 10–14, ordered to match `prepare_rlm_org`'s module load order — tax before billing for the shared LegalEntity dependency — and each guarded by its module's feature flag, so on a base org without those modules they're skipped). Loads each plan twice and fails if any object's record count increases. qb-pcm uses extraction roundtrip by default. Requires `--org`. |

See [Data Management Tasks](#data-management-tasks) for per-task details and group listing.

### Sub-Flows

| Flow | Description | Key Feature Flags |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `prepare_core` | PSL/PSG assignment, context definitions, rule libraries, settings cleanup | `clm`, `einstein`, `dro`, `breconfig`, `billing` |
| `extend_context_definitions` | Extend all standard context definitions | `commerce`, `billing`, `dro`, `clm`, `rating` |
| `prepare_expression_sets` | Deactivate, ensure pricing schedules, deploy expression sets | Scratch only |
| `prepare_product_data` | Load PCM + product image SFDMU data | `qb`, `q3` |
| `prepare_pricing_data` | Load pricing SFDMU data | `qb` |
| `prepare_scratch` | Insert scratch-only data | Scratch only, not `tso` |
| `prepare_quantumbit` | Deploy QuantumBit metadata, permissions, CALM delete | `quantumbit`, `billing`, `approvals`, `calmdelete` |
| `prepare_tso` | TSO-specific PSL/PSG/permissions/metadata | `tso` |
| `prepare_dro` | Load DRO data (dynamic user resolution), PFDR update (260 bug fix) | `dro`, `qb`, `q3` |
| `prepare_clm` | Load CLM data | `clm`, `clm_data` |
| `prepare_docgen` | Create docgen library, enable Document Builder + Document Templates Export + Design Document Templates toggles, deploy metadata | `docgen` |
| `prepare_billing` | Load billing data, activate flows/records, deploy ID-based settings via XPath transforms, trigger default template auto-creation (3-step cycle) | `billing`, `qb`, `q3`, `refresh` |
| `prepare_prm` | Create community, patch Network email, deploy PRM metadata, revert Network email, publish community, assign RLM_PRM permission set, load PRM data; optionally invokes `prepare_prm_pricing` when `prm_pricing=true` | `prm`, `prm_exp_bundle`, `prm_pricing`, `qb` |
| `prepare_tax` | Create tax engine, load data, activate records | `tax`, `qb`, `q3`, `refresh` |
| `prepare_rating` | Load rating + rates data, activate | `rating`, `rates`, `qb`, `q3`, `refresh` |
| `extract_rating` | Extract rating and rates data from an org | -- |
| `prepare_agents` | Deploy Agentforce agents, settings, permissions | `agents` |
| `refresh_all_decision_tables` | Sync pricing, refresh all DT categories | `rating`, `commerce`, `tso`, `prm`, `prm_pricing` |

| `prepare_payments` | Deploy payments site, publish community, deploy settings | `payments` |

### UX Assembly Flow

| Flow | Description | Feature Flag |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `prepare_ux` | Step 1: `assemble_and_deploy_ux` — resolves feature-conditional sources from `templates/`, assembles `unpackaged/post_ux/`, deploys in a single `sf project deploy start`. Step 2: `reorder_app_launcher` — applies App Launcher order via Aura API on all `ux=true` orgs. Runs at step 29 of `prepare_rlm_org`. | `ux` |

**Assembly rules:** Flexipages use last-feature-wins source resolution (order: `payments → billing → billing_ui → quantumbit → tso → constraints → utils → docgen → approvals → collections → prm_pricing`) followed by sequential YAML patch application (order: `quantumbit → utils → guidedselling → billing → billing_ui → payments → approvals → docgen → tso → constraints → collections → prm_pricing`). One canonical standalone version per page — pages are not duplicated across feature dirs. `tso/standalone` is intentionally empty; TSO builds inherit from QB via the `tso > qb > base` priority chain. App `actionOverrides` for billing and rates are injected via `templates/applications/patches/{feature}/` on non-TSO builds. See [Dynamic UX Assembly](docs/features/dynamic-ux-assembly.md) for full architecture.

### Utility Flows and Tasks

| Flow/Task | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `deploy_full` | Task | Full metadata deployment (source, pre/post bundles) |
| `activate_and_deploy_expression_sets` | Task | Re-deploy expression sets with Draft status transformed to Active via XPath |

## Data Plans

Data plans provide the reference data loaded during org setup. This project uses two mechanisms:

### SFDMU Data Plans

> **Requires SFDMU v5.6.4+.** All data plans have been migrated for SFDMU v5 compatibility
> and idempotency. See [Composite Key Optimizations](docs/references/sfdmu-composite-key-optimizations.md)
> for the full migration details and known limitations.

SFDMU data plans are located under `datasets/sfdmu/` and are loaded by the `load_sfdmu_data` task infrastructure. Each plan contains an `export.json` defining the objects, fields, and ordering for SFDMU.

#### Validating SFDMU Data Plans

The project includes `scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py` for validating SFDMU v5 compliance:

**Validation:**

```bash
# Validate all SFDMU datasets
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py

# Validate specific dataset
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --dataset datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-billing

# Validate all QB datasets
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --dataset datasets/sfdmu/qb

# Generate report file
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --output docs/sfdmu_v5_validation_report.md
```

**Automatic Fixes:**

```bash
# Fix empty CSV headers
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --fix-headers

# Fix missing composite key columns
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --fix-composite-keys

# Fix all issues (dry-run first recommended)
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --fix-all --dry-run
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --fix-all
```

The validator checks for:

- Legacy `$$` notation in externalId definitions (v5 requires semicolon format)
- Missing composite key columns in CSVs
- Empty CSV files without headers
- Nested relationship paths that cause v5 flattening errors

To generate a validation report:

```bash
# Console output
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py

# Save to file
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --output validation_report.md
```

#### Data plan directory structure

Plans follow a **shape / locale / plan-name** tree so multiple data shapes (e.g. QuantumBit, Manufacturing) can coexist:

```
datasets/sfdmu/
├── <shape>/           # e.g. qb, mfg, q3
│   └── <locale>/      # e.g. en-US
│       └── <plan-name>/   # e.g. qb-pcm, mfg-pcm
│           ├── export.json
│           ├── Object1.csv
│           ├── Object2.csv
│           └── (optional) objectset_source/   # for multi-pass plans
├── procedure-plans/
└── extractions/       # extract output: <plan-name>/<timestamp>/ and .../processed/
```

**Examples:** `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm`, `datasets/sfdmu/mfg/en-US/mfg-pcm`. The same tooling (extract task, post-process script, idempotency task) works for any plan path: each task gets its plan directory from `cumulusci.yml` via a path anchor, and extraction output goes to `datasets/sfdmu/extractions/<plan-name>/<timestamp>/` (and `<timestamp>/processed/` after post-process).

**Adding a new data shape (e.g. mfg):**

1. Create the directory tree: `datasets/sfdmu/mfg/en-US/<plan-name>/` (e.g. `mfg-pcm`).
2. Add `export.json` and CSV files following the same patterns as QB (single-pass with flat `objects`, or multi-pass with `objectSets`; see [qb-pcm](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm/README.md) or [qb-rating](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-rating/README.md) as reference).
3. In `cumulusci.yml`, under **DATA PLAN NAMES AND PATHS**, add an anchor (e.g. `mfg_pcm_dataset: &mfg_pcm_dataset "datasets/sfdmu/mfg/en-US/mfg-pcm"`).
4. Add load, extract, and idempotency tasks that reference that anchor (`pathtoexportjson: *mfg_pcm_dataset`). Use the same task classes (`LoadSFDMUData`, `ExtractSFDMUData`, `TestSFDMUIdempotency`) and groups (Data Management - Extract / Idempotency) so extract runs post-process by default and output goes to `extractions/mfg-pcm/<timestamp>/processed/`.
5. Add a README in the plan directory and, if desired, list the plan in the table below.

#### QuantumBit (QB) Data Plans

| Data Plan | Directory | Description | Documentation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| qb-pcm | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm/` | Product Catalog Management -- products, classifications, components, attributes | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm/README.md) |
| qb-product-images | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-product-images/` | Product images and content document links | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-product-images/README.md) |
| qb-pricing | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pricing/` | Pricing data (pricebook entries, price adjustments) | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pricing/README.md) |
| qb-tax | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-tax/` | Tax engine data (tax treatments, policies) | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-tax/README.md) |
| qb-billing | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-billing/` | Billing data (billing terms, schedules) | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-billing/README.md) |
| qb-dro | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-dro/` | Dynamic Revenue Orchestration plans | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-dro/README.md) |
| qb-transactionprocessingtypes | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-transactionprocessingtypes/` | Transaction Processing Type records | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-transactionprocessingtypes/README.md) |
| qb-rating | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-rating/` | Rating design-time data | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-rating/README.md) |
| qb-rates | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-rates/` | Rates data | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-rates/README.md) |
| qb-prm | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-prm/` | Partner Relationship Management (channel programs, levels, members) | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-prm/README.md) |
| qb-prm-pricing | `datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-prm-pricing/` | PRM pricing overlay data (partner accounts, channel programs, member pricing, account self-lookups) | [README](datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-prm-pricing/README.md) |

#### Procedure Plans Data Plan

| Data Plan | Directory | Description | Documentation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| procedure-plans | `datasets/sfdmu/procedure-plans/` | Procedure Plan sections and options with expression set links (2-pass upsert + Connect API + activation) | [README](datasets/sfdmu/procedure-plans/README.md) |

Procedure-plan overlays that require resolved parent IDs live under
`datasets/procedure_plan_overlays/` and are applied by dedicated CCI tasks
rather than SFDMU.

#### Archived Data Plans

Deprecated data plans are retained in `datasets/sfdmu/_archived/` for reference. These are no longer used:

- `qb-constraints-product` -- replaced by CML utility
- `qb-constraints-component` -- replaced by CML utility
- `qb-constraints-consolidated` -- replaced by CML utility
- `qb-constraints-prc-aisummit` -- replaced by CML utility

### Constraint Model Data Plans

Constraint model data is managed by the Python-based CML utility (`tasks/rlm_cml.py`) instead of SFDMU. These plans are stored under `datasets/constraints/` and include CSVs for Expression Sets, ESC associations, and the ConstraintModel blobs — which are **plain-text CML**, uploaded verbatim, not compiled binaries.

| Model | Directory | ESC Records | Active after `prepare_constraints`? |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| QuantumBitBundle | `datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitBundle/` | 61 | **yes** — the active QuantumBit model |
| QuantumBitComplete | `datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitComplete/` | 57 | no — imported inactive, kept for A/B |
| QuantumBitPCM | `datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitPCM/` | 12 | no — imported inactive, kept for A/B |
| Server2 | `datasets/constraints/qb/Server2/` | 81 | **yes** — hardware model, not part of the QuantumBit family |

Exactly one QuantumBit model may be active at a time; `Server2` is a separate model and
is active alongside it.

For details on exporting new models, importing into target orgs, polymorphic ID resolution, and CCI integration, see the [Constraints Utility Guide](datasets/constraints/README.md).

## Common Workflows

### Full Org Setup

```bash
# 1. Create scratch org using an existing definition
cci org scratch dev-sb0 my-org

# 2. Set as default
cci org default my-org

# 3. Run full deployment flow
cci flow run prepare_rlm_org
```

### Skip UX Assembly

```bash
# Run full flow without assembling/deploying any UX metadata (useful for isolated testing)
cci flow run prepare_rlm_org -o ux false
```

### Assemble and Deploy UX Metadata

```bash
# Assemble all UX metadata and deploy (same as step 29)
cci flow run prepare_ux

# Dry-run only — inspect unpackaged/post_ux/ without deploying
cci task run assemble_and_deploy_ux -o deploy false

# Regenerate and deploy a single flexipage by full filename
cci task run assemble_and_deploy_ux \
    -o metadata_name RLM_Quote_Record_Page.flexipage-meta.xml

# Assemble only layouts (no deploy)
cci task run assemble_and_deploy_ux -o metadata_type layouts -o deploy false
```

### Deploy Specific Features

```bash
# Enable a feature flag in cumulusci.yml, then:
cci flow run prepare_rlm_org
```

### Prepare Constraints (with Data)

```bash
# Run constraints flow with CML data loading enabled
cci flow run prepare_constraints --org <org> -o constraints_data true
```

This will validate CML files, import all four constraint models (QuantumBitComplete, Server2, QuantumBitPCM, and QuantumBitBundle), then deactivate all four versions and activate **two** of them — `Server2_V1` and `QuantumBitBundle_V1`. QuantumBitComplete and QuantumBitPCM are imported but left inactive for A/B comparison. See [Constraints Setup](docs/guides/constraints-setup.md) for flow details.

### Export a Constraint Model

```bash
# Export from a source org to a local data plan directory
cci task run export_cml --org <source_org> \
    -o developer_name QuantumBitComplete \
    -o version 1 \
    -o output_dir datasets/constraints/qb/QuantumBitComplete
```

See the [Constraints Utility Guide](datasets/constraints/README.md) for full export/import/validate documentation.

### App Launcher order

```bash
# Capture the running user's order as a reference snapshot (writes templates/appMenus/base/; no deploy)
python scripts/sync_appmenu_from_user.py

# Apply the App Launcher order (runs as step 2 of prepare_ux on all ux=true orgs)
cci flow run prepare_ux --org <org>

# Apply the App Launcher order only, without the rest of prepare_ux
# (reorder_app_launcher orders by its priority_app_labels option via Aura saveOrder; assemble_and_deploy_ux
#  does NOT handle appMenus, and AppSwitcher can't deploy via the Metadata API when the AppMenu contains
#  managed ConnectedApp/Network entries — the Trialforce case)
cci task run reorder_app_launcher --org <org>
```

### Load Product Data

```bash
# Load QuantumBit PCM data
cci task run insert_quantumbit_pcm_data

# Load product images
cci task run insert_quantumbit_product_image_data
```

### Load Billing Data

```bash
cci task run insert_billing_data
```

The `prepare_billing` flow deploys Billing Settings in a 3-step cycle to properly configure ID-based fields and trigger default template auto-creation:

1. **Step 6** (`deploy_post_billing`): Enable billing toggles (`enableInvoiceEmailDelivery`, `enableInvoicePdfGeneration` = `true`) and set `billingContextDefinition`
2. **Step 7** (`deploy_billing_id_settings`): Set context mapping, DPE definition names, and record IDs via XPath transforms; disable invoice toggles (`false`)
3. **Step 8** (`deploy_billing_template_settings`): Re-enable invoice toggles (`true`) to trigger Salesforce auto-creation of default invoice preview and document templates

The ID fields (`defaultBillingTreatment`, `defaultLegalEntity`, `defaultTaxTreatment`) use XPath transform SOQL queries to resolve org-specific record IDs at deploy time. The `billingContextDefinition` must be deployed in step 6 (before step 7) because `billingContextSourceMapping` requires it to already be persisted.

DRO data (prepare_dro flow) uses a single **qb-dro** data plan for both scratch and non-scratch orgs. The task replaces the placeholder `__DRO_ASSIGNED_TO_USER__` in `FulfillmentStepDefinition.csv`, `User.csv`, and `UserAndGroup.csv` with the target org's default user Name (e.g. "User User" in scratch orgs, "Admin User" in TSO) before loading. Step 4 runs `update_product_fulfillment_decomp_rules` (Apex) as a temporary fix for a 260 bug: ExecuteOnRuleId is not generated on INSERT and must be triggered by an UPDATE. No separate scratch-specific DRO plan is required.

### Extract Rating Data

```bash
# Extract rating and rates data from an org
cci flow run extract_rating --org <org>
```

### Manage Decision Tables

```bash
# List all active decision tables (with UsageType)
cci task run manage_decision_tables --operation list

# Validate project list anchors against the org
cci task run manage_decision_tables --operation validate_lists

# Refresh all decision tables (full or incremental)
cci task run manage_decision_tables --operation refresh
# Or use the flow: cci flow run refresh_all_decision_tables
```
Decision table activate/deactivate and expression set version activation use CCI tasks only; the former SFDMU data plans for these have been removed.

## Troubleshooting

### Fixing a global pip install (headless robot tasks)

If you installed Robot Framework or SeleniumLibrary with `pip install` and got a warning about modifying the global environment:

1. Uninstall from the Python you used:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip uninstall -y robotframework-seleniumlibrary robotframework selenium webdriver-manager
   ```
2. Install them into CumulusCI's environment so headless robot tasks can run. If you use **pipx** for CumulusCI:
   ```bash
   pipx inject cumulusci --force -r robot/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run `cci task run validate_setup` to confirm all headless robot dependencies (Robot, selenium 4.10+, SeleniumLibrary, webdriver-manager, Chrome/Chromium, ChromeDriver). Once the org is ready, run the task to confirm end-to-end.

### Headless robot: Chrome/Chromium or ChromeDriver not found

Robot tasks run headless and require Chrome or Chromium plus ChromeDriver. Run `cci task run validate_setup` to diagnose. Common fixes:

- **Chrome/Chromium missing:** Install per [Setup for headless robot runs](#setup-for-headless-robot-runs) (macOS: `brew install chromium`; Linux: `apt install chromium`).
- **ChromeDriver missing:** Install webdriver-manager (`pipx inject cumulusci webdriver-manager`) so it downloads ChromeDriver at runtime, or install chromedriver on PATH (e.g. `apt install chromium-driver` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- **CI:** Set `CHROME_BIN` to the browser path (e.g. `/usr/bin/chromium`).

### Document Builder: "Timeout value connect was &lt;object object at ...&gt;"

This is a Selenium 3.x / urllib3 2.x compatibility issue. Selenium 3.x passes `socket._GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` (a sentinel `object()`) to `urllib3.PoolManager`, which urllib3 2.x rejects. This project requires `selenium>=4.10`, which does not have this issue — if you see this error, selenium 3.x is still installed in the CCI pipx venv. Upgrade it:

```bash
pipx inject cumulusci --force -r robot/requirements.txt
```

The `--force` flag is required to upgrade already-installed packages. Then re-run the Document Builder task or flow.

### CumulusCI Not Found

```bash
# Install CumulusCI (prefer pipx to avoid global Python install)
pipx install cumulusci
# If you don't use pipx, use a virtual environment first, then: pip install cumulusci

# Verify installation
cci version
```

### SFDMU Not Found or Outdated

```bash
# Install or update SFDMU (v5.6.4+ required)
sf plugins install sfdmu

# Verify installation (should show 5.6.4 or later)
sf plugins list
```

The `validate_setup` task checks and auto-updates SFDMU when `auto_fix=true` (the default):
```bash
cci task run validate_setup
```

### SFDMU Duplicate Records on Re-run

If you see duplicate records after running data tasks multiple times, verify you are on
SFDMU v5. The data plans have been migrated for v5 idempotency; v4.x may create duplicates
due to differences in how composite `externalId` definitions are processed. See
[Composite Key Optimizations](docs/references/sfdmu-composite-key-optimizations.md) for details.

### Permission Set Groups stuck Outdated / Updating

- After assigning permission set licenses or deploying PSG metadata, the platform may queue recalculation. The `recalculate_permission_set_groups` task waits with an initial delay, polls for Updated status, and retries with a delay on timeout (see `initial_delay_seconds`, `retry_count`, `retry_delay_seconds`, `post_trigger_delay_seconds` in `cumulusci.yml`). If you still hit timeouts, increase those options or run the flow again once the org has finished recalculating.

### Permission Errors

- Ensure your Salesforce user has appropriate permissions
- For scratch orgs, ensure Dev Hub is enabled
- Check org access: `sf org display`

### Deployment Errors

- Check feature flags in `cumulusci.yml` match your org's capabilities
- Review deployment logs for specific error messages
- Some features require specific licenses (e.g., Einstein, QuantumBit)

### Constraint Import Errors

- **MALFORMED_QUERY**: Product names with special characters (single quotes, backslashes) can cause SOQL issues. The CML utility automatically escapes these, but if you encounter this error, check that you're using the latest `tasks/rlm_cml.py`.
- **NOT_FOUND for ExpressionSetConstraintObj**: The target org may not have the RLM Constraints feature enabled. Enable it in Setup before running the import.
- **Could not resolve ReferenceObjectId**: The target org is missing products or PRC records that the constraint model references. Ensure the product data plan (e.g., `qb-pcm`) has been loaded first.
