"""Safety-critical activation lifecycle for BRE Expression Set mutations.

Part of the self-contained ``scripts/expression_sets/`` toolkit (imports nothing
from ``tasks/``). :class:`LifecycleEngine` wraps a :class:`_client.Transport` and
encapsulates the deactivate → mutate → reactivate sequencer, the
``ProcedurePlanDefinitionVersion`` cascade, the version-state
(``ExpressionSetVersion.IsActive``) transitions, the
``ExpressionSet.ResourceInitializationType`` alignment, and the Connect
GET/PATCH/POST/DELETE on the expression-set resource. It mirrors the
live-verified rules of the CCI task ``tasks/rlm_expression_set_connect.py``
(reference-only) so the CLIs give the same guarantees, without sharing code.

The load-bearing guarantees (verified on 262 / v67.0):

  * A Connect mutation requires the version **inactive**. An active version (and
    any referencing procedure-plan versions, when ``cascade``) is deactivated
    first, then reactivated on success.
  * Reactivation is governed by the explicit ``activate_after`` flag, NOT the
    prior active state — an explicit false wins (leaves it off for inspection).
  * **PATCH is not atomic.** A failed PATCH can leave a half-mutated, deactivated
    version. It is NEVER reactivated — re-enabling a corrupted pricing procedure
    is worse than leaving it offline. Reactivation happens only when
    ``activate_after`` AND the mutate body succeeded (or in dry-run, where
    nothing changed).

Dry-run is driven by the injected ``Transport`` (``Transport(dry_run=True)``):
mutating verbs are logged and skipped at the request layer; reads always run so
a dry-run still resolves ids and logs the real mutation sequence. The engine
only additionally skips the activation-state *polls* under dry-run (there is no
state change to wait for).

Errors raise :class:`LifecycleError`. The engine takes the transport as its one
dependency, so a unit test can pass a fake transport and assert the call
sequence without an org.
