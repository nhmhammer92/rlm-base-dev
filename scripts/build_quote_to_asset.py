"""Build a backdated Quote -> Order -> Asset chain, then verify usage buckets.

Purpose
-------
Usage rating can only be exercised against assets that already carry usage
entitlements ("wallets"), and the interesting cases are *backdated* — an asset
purchased earlier so a billing period has actually closed. Producing that state
by hand through the UI takes several minutes per account and is easy to get
subtly wrong (a line that starts today, a quote in the user's currency instead
of the account's). This script produces it reproducibly.

What it uses, and why
---------------------
The org's own utilities are used wherever they can be reached headlessly:

1. **Opportunity** — mirrors ``RLM_QuickQuote`` (``unpackaged/post_utils``)
   field-for-field. That flow is a *screen* flow so Apex cannot invoke it, but
   every automation it relies on is record-triggered, so the same insert fires
   the same behaviour (notably the account-currency defaulting added for
   multicurrency).
2. **Quote + line** — ``POST /connect/rev/sales-transaction/actions/place``
   (Place Sales Transaction) with an object graph. Direct ``QuoteLineItem`` DML
   is *not* viable for a TermDefined product: the platform requires
   ``BillingFrequency`` and simultaneously refuses to let you set it unless the
   line's BillingTreatment has ``CanChangeBillingFrequency = true``. The
   transaction API is the supported path.
3. **Order** — the standard ``createOrdersFromQuote`` invocable, which is
   exactly what the Create Order quick action runs via
   ``RLM_CreateOrdersFromQuote``.
4. **Activation** — the Draft -> Activated status transition, which is what the
   UI's Activate button does and what ``RLM_Submit_Order_on_Activation`` reacts
   to. v67.0 exposes no Connect resource for order activation.

Endpoints that older Postman collections still list are **gone** in v67.0 and
return NOT_FOUND: ``/commerce/sales-transactions/actions/place``,
``/commerce/quotes/actions/create-order``, and
``/connect/revenue-management/orders/actions/activate``.

Selling model drives which line fields are legal
------------------------------------------------
Not the product — the **selling model** behind the chosen PricebookEntry:

===========  ==========================  ==========================
model        BillingFrequency            EndDate
===========  ==========================  ==========================
TermDefined  required                    allowed
Evergreen    required                    rejected
OneTime      must be null/MilestonePlan  rejected
===========  ==========================  ==========================

A product may expose several (QB-DAT-THPT has Evergreen, Term Monthly and Term
Annual), so ``--selling-model`` picks which PricebookEntry to use.

Commitment products need a post-assetization link
-------------------------------------------------
A commitment and its anchor are sold as SEPARATE quotes and assetized
independently, then tied together through the ``UsageCmtAssetRelatedObj``
junction (help: *Sell Commitment-Based Usage Products*, step 3)::

    --sku QB-CMT-TKN-TIER --link-commitment QB-DB-TOKEN

Nothing in the catalog can express this pairing: ``UsagePrdGrantBindingPolicy``
rejects commit products ("Select a Product with the Usage Model Type as Anchor
or Pack") and *"You can't bind a commitment-based usage product to a target."*
Without the junction the commitment is inert — consumption drains the anchor's
grant and rates at the anchor's rate. With it, consumption draws from the
committed amount first, at the discounted commit rate.

Because the junction joins two **Assets**, it is transactional data and can
never live in a design-time SFDMU plan.

Pack products need an anchor
----------------------------
A ``UsageModelType = Pack`` product draws down against an anchor's wallet and
cannot be sold alone — activation fails with *"the usage product is missing a
binding instance"*. Pass ``--anchor-sku`` to bind the line to an anchor asset
that already exists on the account (via ``BindingInstanceTargetId``), e.g.::

    --sku QB-TOKENS-PACK --anchor-sku QB-DB-TOKEN

Prerequisite
------------
Each target account must be reset first (no existing asset for the SKU) — the
asset is matched on account + product because ``Asset`` carries no lookup back
to the Order or Quote it came from. This is now **enforced**: a preflight check
refuses to run when a matching asset already exists. Pass
``--allow-existing-asset`` to proceed anyway, in which case the post-activation
poll requires a genuinely NEW asset id rather than accepting the old one.
