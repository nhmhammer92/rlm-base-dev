"""The transaction lifecycle, transcribed from the live-verified contracts.

Each function isolates one lifecycle step behind a single call so the rest of
the tool is endpoint/shape-agnostic. Bodies, response shapes, ordering hazards,
and async behavior are exactly as locked in ``scripts/txn_data_harness/CONTRACTS.md``
(verified against a Revenue Cloud R262 scratch org, API v67.0). When changing
anything here, re-verify against the org and update CONTRACTS.md in the same
change.

Step ordering (hard barriers -- see CONTRACTS.md "Timing & Sequencing"):

    (opportunity) -> place(quote) -> create_order -> set_shipping_address
        -> activate_order -> [activation auto-generates BillingSchedule + Asset]

``set_shipping_address`` is MANDATORY before ``activate_order``:
createOrderFromQuote does not copy the account's shipping address, and
activation hard-fails FAILED_ACTIVATION without it.

    """Place a quote with one or more lines. Returns the Quote id.

    Each :class:`LineItem` becomes a QuoteLineItem in the place graph, so a
    scenario can place a **multi-line** quote (one referenceId per line). A
    line's ``discount_percent`` (0..100), when given, sets its ``Discount``
    (a standard percent field, createable). PST runs with ``pricingPref:
    "System"``, so the pricing engine *consumes* the discount and reflects it in
    the derived net prices, which flow through to the posted invoice. Verified
    live (CONTRACTS.md "Line discounts"): a 25% input drove QuoteLineItem
    ``NetUnitPrice`` to 337.50 (= 450 x 0.75) and the Posted Invoice
    ``TotalAmount`` to the discounted figure. NOTE: the engine does not
    round-trip the input onto ``QuoteLineItem.Discount`` -- that field reads back
    ``0`` post-place; the discount lives in the net prices, not that column.

    Gotchas locked in CONTRACTS.md:
      * use QuoteAccountId (AccountId is not writable on the graph record)
      * do NOT send ProductSellingModelId on the line (FLS error -- verified
        unwritable even as admin; the engine resolves the model from the PBE)
      * EndDate is selling-model-dependent (set by ``product.needs_end_date``):
        TermDefined REQUIRES it (else END_DATE_MISSING); Evergreen and OneTime
        REJECT it at createOrderFromQuote ("can't specify EndDate for
        evergreen/one-time order products"). StartDate is safe for all.
      * PST commits the Quote header even on isSuccess:false -> caller records
        the returned id for cleanup regardless.

    Term handling is per-line (see ``LineItem.term``). For TermDefined
    products the harness writes the author-input fields ``SubscriptionTerm`` +
    ``SubscriptionTermUnit`` -- the platform derives ``EndDate`` from
    ``StartDate`` + those two fields (live-verified on R262 against
    ``rlm-base__jun17_1``: input SubscriptionTerm=1 Annual + StartDate=2026-01-15
    read back as EndDate=2027-01-14, platform's inclusive ``start + term - 1
    day`` convention). The same input also drives platform recalculation of the
    auto-calc fields ``PricingTerm`` / ``PricingTermCount``; the harness writes
    neither.

    When ``line.end_date`` is set, the harness ALSO writes an explicit
    ``EndDate`` (resolved against the line's StartDate). The platform honors
    the override and prorates ``PricingTermCount`` against the actual span,
    e.g. an explicit Jan 15 -> Jan 15 next year (366 days) yields
    ``PricingTermCount = 366/365 = 1.0027`` instead of the derived 1.0. Used
    for co-terming a multi-line quote to a single calendar anchor.

    ``start_date`` (default today) sets every line's ``StartDate``; the
    platform anchors the TermDefined ``EndDate`` off it. Pass a
    per-transaction date to spread quotes over time.

    """Wait for activation-generated Asset(s) attributable to ``order_id``.

    Asset has no direct order FK, but the data model exposes a deterministic
    one-hop linkage via AssetActionSource (CONTRACTS.md "Asset attribution"):

        Order -> OrderItem
              -> AssetActionSource.ReferenceEntityItemId
              -> AssetAction.AssetId
              -> Asset

    We query AssetActionSource rows whose ``ReferenceEntityItemId`` points at
    one of this order's OrderItems, filtered to ``category_enum`` (default
    ``'Initial Sale'``) so amendments/renewals/cancellations on the same
    OrderItem never bleed into an activation poll.

    Why this beats the prior account+product+created-date heuristic:

      * Bundles: a one-line input like QB-COMPLETE expands server-side into N
        component OrderItems with different Product2Ids. The old SOQL was keyed
        on the input line's Product2Id, so it never saw the component assets.
        Live: order 801WI00001HsyrdYAB produced 5 assets; the old poll captured
        1. The AAS path returns all 5.
      * Concurrency: the old SOQL also matched peer scenarios' assets in the
        same account+product+time window, and a process-global claim registry
        papered over duplicate ids at the cost of greedy over-attribution
        (peers timed out with empty asset_ids). The AAS path is per-order, so
        siblings on the same account+product never collide.
      * Replay/clock-skew: drops the client-side ``since_iso`` window entirely.

    Exit condition: ``expected_count`` is not derivable at call time -- bundles
    decouple OrderItem count from asset count, and ``count_order_items`` would
    over-count for any future scenario with non-asset-producing component
    OrderItems. Instead, the poll converges when the AAS-returned sorted ID set
    is identical to the previous tick's set for ``stable_ticks`` consecutive
    observations (default 2 = three identical observations total). The extra
    tick protects against a staggered wave that briefly appears stable before
    the final AAS rows land.
    Live timing measured against rlm-base__jun17_1 (2026-06-23): Asset created
    01:28:44, AAS created 01:28:45 (1s lag, simple case); same-second for the
    bundle case -- both well within one tick.

    LMA invariant: every Revenue Cloud activation produces LMA assets, so
    AssetActionSource is the complete picture -- no non-LMA escape hatch to
    worry about. An empty poll result means either the AAS write hasn't
    landed yet (handled by the stable-count loop) or activation itself
    didn't produce assets (an upstream contract violation, surfaced by the
    timeout warning).

    Failure mode: assets are best-effort relative to the billing gate, so
    the poll soft-fails on timeout (warn + return ``[]`` rather than raise).
    ``run_usage`` raises hard downstream if it can't pair a usage line,
    which is the right place for an empty-pool error to surface.

    """POST a Composite-Graph-shaped Invoice to the ingest endpoint.

    Returns ``(invoice_id, invoice_number, invoice_line_ids)``. ``status`` is
    ``"Draft"`` or ``"Posted"``. The dev guide (R262/v67.0) caps the action
    body at one invoice per request; concurrency lives in the harness's
    thread pool.

    Tax model:

    * Non-taxable lines (default) carry the org's non-taxable
      ``TaxTreatment`` id (``tax_treatment_id``) and no ``InvoiceLineTax``
      graph record. ``shouldCalculateTax`` stays ``false`` on the request
      header.
    * Taxable lines (``ResolvedInvoiceLine.taxable=True``) carry the org's
      taxable ``TaxTreatment`` id (``taxable_tax_treatment_id``) and an
      ``InvoiceLineTax`` graph record built from
      ``ResolvedInvoiceLine.tax``. The handler resolves both ids before
      calling here.
    * Mixed payloads (some taxable, some not) are allowed; per-line
      stamping ensures each InvoiceLine matches its tax treatment.

    ``tax_treatment_id`` is the org's non-taxable ``TaxTreatment`` (resolved
    via :func:`discovery.resolve_non_taxable_tax_treatment`). When provided,
    every non-taxable InvoiceLine graph record stamps ``taxTreatmentId``.
    Posted ingest requires it -- without a stamp the action resolves the
    org's default taxable policy and rejects with INVALID_API_INPUT.
    Stamping on Draft too means the Draft -> Posted resume path
    (``actions/post`` on the saved Draft id) inherits the same id and the
    post succeeds; an unstamped Draft that later gets posted would have the
    default taxable policy applied silently by ``actions/post`` (verified
    live 2026-06-25 on rlm-base__jun17_1).

    ``taxable_tax_treatment_id`` mirrors that for taxable lines: every line
    with ``taxable=True`` and an ``InvoiceLineTax`` record stamps this id.
    The handler raises before calling here if any taxable line is present
    on Posted target without a treatment to stamp.

    ``uniqueIdentifier`` is set to ``run_id`` so duplicate calls with the same
    run won't double-create. After the action returns ``statusURL``, polls the
    AsyncOperationTracker via :func:`_await_async_tracker` and then reads the
    persisted Invoice row back by ``UniqueIdentifier`` to recover the assigned
    id, number, and line ids.

    ``invoice_spec`` carries the scenario's ``invoice:`` overrides
    (``invoice_date``, ``due_date``, ``posted_date``, ``currency``,
    ``description``, ``tax_calculation_status``). ``None`` means all platform
    defaults; ``posted_date`` is defaulted to today on Posted status when the
    override is omitted.
