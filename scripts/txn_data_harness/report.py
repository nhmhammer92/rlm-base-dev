"""Structured batch reporting for Transaction Data Harness runs.

The build harness's ``reporting.py`` is tightly coupled to CCI step JSONL and
flag overrides, so this replicates only the *concept* on top of the data this
harness already produces: the list of ``Manifest`` records from a batch.

``build_batch_report`` returns a deterministic dict with totals, a per-stage
histogram of how far scenarios got, and a failure-signature rollup (mirroring
the build harness's ``signature_index``) so an operator or AI agent can see at a
glance which failures recurred and on which runs.
