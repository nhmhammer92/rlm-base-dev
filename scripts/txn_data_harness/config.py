"""Config spec load / validate / merge for the demo data generator.

A run is described by a list of :class:`ScenarioSpec` -- each spec is one
account/product shape repeated ``count`` times. With no config file the tool
synthesizes a single spec from CLI flags + built-in defaults, so it runs against
a fresh org with zero configuration; a ``--config`` file lets one run mix several
shapes (e.g. billable-account ``post`` orders + pipeline-only-account
``quote``-only pipeline data, in any combination of accounts available in the
target org).

Specs here are *un-resolved*: they carry account *names* and product *SKUs*, not
org ids. ``generate.py`` resolves them against discovery so this module stays a
pure parse/validate/merge layer with no org dependency.

Precedence (most specific wins):

    per-scenario field  >  CLI flag  >  config ``defaults``  >  built-in default

CLI flags override the broad ``defaults`` block; an explicit per-scenario value
is the most specific intent and wins over everything. ``--with-opportunity`` is a
store_true flag, so it can only *enable* (never force-disable) -- pin
``with_opportunity: false`` per scenario in config to opt a scenario out.
