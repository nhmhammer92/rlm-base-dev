"""Shared base handler for PST-spine scenario kinds.

Both ``sales_txn_quote`` and ``sales_txn_order`` drive the same post-Quote/
post-Order tail: ``order_activated -> usage_upload -> invoice_draft ->
invoice_posted``. Only the head differs -- quote-path goes through PST place
+ ``order_from_quote``; order-path goes through PST place-on-Order
(``order_direct``). The split lives in each subclass's :attr:`STAGES` and
:attr:`STEP_GRAPH`; the resolve/run/retry/summarize logic is shared here so a
bug fix in the retry loop or a new public-stage rule lands in one place.

The base is intentionally *not* a ``Protocol`` -- it carries concrete
implementations the runtime calls into. :class:`scripts.txn_data_harness.
handlers.base.ScenarioHandler` is still the public contract (runtime-checked
in tests); subclasses satisfy it structurally.
