"""Invoice-ingestion scenario handler.

Drives the standalone-billing invoice ingestion path (Composite Graph ingest
action). Counterpart to :class:`SalesTxnQuoteHandler` /
:class:`SalesTxnOrderHandler`: same protocol, very different lifecycle. The
PST chain walks Opportunity -> Quote -> Order ->
Activate -> Usage -> Invoice -> Post; supported ingestion configs ship one POST
that creates a Draft invoice in a single composite-graph call. The Posted path
creates a Draft then promotes via ``promote_to_posted``, stamping a non-taxable
TaxTreatment and building the InvoiceLineTax graph when required.

The handler owns its own step graph:

    invoice -> [ingest_invoice]
    post    -> [ingest_invoice, promote_to_posted]

``promote_to_posted`` is a no-op when ``ingest_invoice`` already produced a
Posted invoice in the same run (the handler's STEP_GRAPH for ``post`` always
includes both steps so the manifest-level resume math is simple -- the
no-op short-circuit lives in :func:`steps.run_promote_to_posted`).
