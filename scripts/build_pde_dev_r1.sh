# build_pde_dev_r1.sh — Build a Partner Development Environment (PDE) org.
#
# Provisions a NEW, uniquely-aliased scratch org (pde<datetimestamp><pid>) from
# the `tfid-pde` scratch shape and runs `prepare_rlm_org` with two runtime-only
# feature-flag overrides applied to cumulusci.yml:
#
#     pde:        false -> true
#     billing_ui: true  -> false
#
# All other feature flags stay exactly as committed on the current branch.
#
# Nothing the build touches is left in the working tree:
#   * cumulusci.yml is backed up before any edit and restored on exit
#     (success, failure, or interrupt).
#   * The flow regenerates files under unpackaged/post_ux/ (UX assembly) and
#     datasets/sfdmu/ (SFDMU export.json writeback). To guarantee those edits
#     are build-only, the script REQUIRES those paths to be clean before it
#     runs, then reverts all churn there on exit (tracked + untracked). Set
#     CLEAN_BUILD_ARTIFACTS=false to skip both the pre-check and the cleanup and
#     manage those paths yourself.
#
# Each build provisions a FRESH scratch org: if the resolved alias already
# exists the script fails fast rather than reusing a stale/partial org.
#
# Overridable via environment variables:
#   ORG=pde<datetime><pid>       scratch-org alias to create/build (must be unused)
#   SHAPE=tfid-pde               scratch shape (config under orgs.scratch)
#   FLOW=prepare_rlm_org         CCI flow to run
